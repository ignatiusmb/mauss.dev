My workouts started from my journey of trying to gain Full Body Control, I felt that I need to gain full control of my body so in some rare case where I might fall, I'll be able to fall with minimum or no damage to my body. This is what motivates me, and that's when I started to learn breaking and calisthenics.

Having full body control was something I dream of when I was little. I didn't know Calisthenics back then, but I do love dancing. That's when I was introduced to breaking, seeing b-boys spin around like crazy or having their hands above their head on the floor with their legs slicing through the air. It was crazy magnificent, I can't believe how they did it back then, how they managed to have full control of their body but looks like pure chaos from the outside.

[Toprock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toprock) isn't really my style and I can probably say I suck at that. But, that's not really what I aim when I first started learning breaking, so it's fine by me. I was crazy amazed when I saw what the human body could do, doing above 20 windmills rep and going from flare to airflares. It's called [power moves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_move), that's what I wanted to do and that's what I fell in love with doing, but I quickly realize that my body isn't strong enough at the time. That's when I discovered Calisthenics to strengthen myself.

I started doing calisthenics with absolutely no weights, the concept of just lifting weights seems absurd to me. I wouldn't want to lift anything if I can't even lift my own body, I should be able to at least handle my body weight before I try anything heavier than myself. Calisthenics isn't so far off from breaking in a way, both require the user to have full control of their body, but Calisthenics is more focused towards concentric, sometimes eccentric, static movements while breaking is more of a continuous flow movements.
