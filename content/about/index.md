Hey there, my name is Ignatius Bagussuputra and I'm passionate with the applications that I make. I'm also an Open-Source enthusiast that focuses on privacy and transparency, check out my curated page in which I discussed a lot about this topic.

I'm currently a CS undergraduate at the University of Indonesia.

I'm quite a slow typer at around 65 WPM, perhaps I'm too spoiled by mobile keyboard autocomplete with type swiping and my code editor's IntelliSense.

All related social are available at the bottom of all page. Huge shout-out to [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) that has helped me a lot with their really simple and convenient way of making icons and logos for a temporary or sometimes fixed product.
