Hey there, my name is Ignatius Bagussuputra and I'm passionate with the applications that I make. I'm also an Open-Source enthusiast that focuses on privacy and transparency, check out my curated page in which I discussed a lot about this topic.

I'm quite a slow typer at around 65 WPM, perhaps I'm too spoiled by mobile keyboard autocomplete with type swiping and my code editor's IntelliSense. But, I should probably also mention that my current keyboard has a lot of chattering so it gets way harder to type fast and accurately.

All related social are available at the bottom of all page. Huge shout-out to [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) that has helped me a lot with their really simple and convenient way of making icons and logos for a temporary or sometimes fixed product.
