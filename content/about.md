Hey there, my name is Ignatius Bagussuputra and I'm passionate with the applications that I make. I'm also an Open-Source enthusiast that focuses on privacy and transparency, check out my curated page in which I discussed a lot about this topic.

I'm currently a CS undergraduate at the University of Indonesia.

I'm quite a slow typer at around 65 WPM, perhaps I'm too spoiled by mobile keyboard autocomplete with type swiping and my code editor's IntelliSense.

All related social are available at the bottom of all page. Huge shout-out to [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) that has helped me a lot with their really simple and convenient way of making icons and logos for a temporary or sometimes fixed product.

## Sports x Workouts

I'm not the best at a certain sport, but I do love them and I try to be able to play everywhere. I have my preference of course, some that I love the most. Invite me to play when you see me, I'll be happy to play along.

### Sports

Here's my list of sports I've tried, sorted from my least to my most liked. I'll also prepend the year I started it.

- `2006` | Soccer x Futsal

Been playing since elementary, lost my interest at around 4 or 5th grade. But, I still do them because PE (Physical Education).

- `2008` | Basketball

Been playing since elementary, my school is keen on having kids just play with balls for PE.

- `2005` | Running x Walking

Used to love running so much when I was a kid, I'm not sure why I grew out of it. I do love walking alone when I'm in Singapore or other countries. Perhaps the environment here is not suitable for outside walking. I still do walk to places when I'm commuting alone from the train station and the destination is only around 1km or less.

- `2008` | Field Hockey

I'm pretty sure I'll love this more if my school facilitates it. Only got to play it once for a whole year at 4th grade. It was fun back then because I got the advantage of being small and agile with my movements.

- `2005` | Cycling

I think I fell a lot when my Dad removed the training wheels from my bicycle, never regretted it once. So glad I got to learn how to ride by myself so early because I went to places with a bicycle since then. It's only until I got an actual vehicle, but it was still a good childhood memories.

- `2005` | Swimming

Was trained to be able to manuever underwater ever since I was able to walk on two feet. I'm most glad of this skill my Dad taught because it actually saved my life a couple of times, or at least I'll suffer major injuries if I didn't know how to swim.

- `2007` | Badminton

Probably the best sport I had for my childhood. It was fun and nostalgic, playing in front of the house and sometimes with the neighbors.

- `2016` | Tricking / Gymnastics

My tricking journey is a bit weird. It started since I learned breaking, it felt incomplete to not learn this. Having learnt just a bit of tricking seems to progress my journey. I'll discuss this further in the Workouts section so continue there to learn more.

- `2014` | Table Tennis / Ping Pong

Didn't think I'll be able to spin, let alone return the ball to the other side. At least, that's my thought when I saw this for the first time. One of my friend then asked me if I wanted to try. It was so weird at first, but I quickly grew into it and it became my actual daily routine for the rest of my high school. It took almost a year just to consistently return the ball.

I was on my last year of middle school when I first saw this, I then went to take this as the extracurricular for my whole high school. I had one friend who also accompanied me every day on breakfast and lunch breaks to play and monopolize the only good table on school. We always come back soaking wet with sweats, but I am now able to do all kinds of tricks and crazy spins thanks to those *exercises*. This is probably the sport I'm most passionate about.

### Workouts

My workouts started from my journey of trying to gain Full Body Control, I felt that I need to gain full control of my body so in some rare case where I might fall, I'll be able to fall with minimum or no damage to my body. This is what motivates me, and that's when I started to learn breaking and calisthenics.

- `2013` | [Breaking not Breakdancing](https://www.redbull.com/us-en/b-boy-and-b-girl-vs-breakdancer)

Having full body control was something I dream of when I was little. I didn't know Calisthenics back then, but I do love dancing. That's when I was introduced to breaking, seeing b-boys spin around like crazy or having their hands above their head on the floor with their legs slicing through the air. It was crazy magnificent, I can't believe how they did it back then, how they managed to have full control of their body but looks like pure chaos from the outside.

[Toprock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toprock) isn't really my style and I can probably say I suck at that. But, that's not really what I aim when I first started learning breaking, so it's fine by me. I was crazy amazed when I saw what the human body could do, doing above 20 windmills rep and going from flare to airflares. It's called [power moves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_move), that's what I wanted to do and that's what I fell in love with doing, but I quickly realize that my body isn't strong enough at the time. That's when I discovered Calisthenics to strengthen myself.

- `2014` | Calisthenics

I started doing calisthenics with absolutely no weights, the concept of just lifting weights seems absurd to me. I wouldn't want to lift anything if I can't even lift my own body, I should be able to at least handle my body weight before I try anything heavier than myself. Calisthenics isn't so far off from breaking in a way, both require the user to have full control of their body, but Calisthenics is more focused towards concentric, sometimes eccentric, static movements while breaking is more of a continuous flow movements.

## Socials at Footer and additional ones

- Facebook

I don't really use FB anymore, never actually, but there's still some good memories in it so I just keep it for the sake of having one. Feel free to cringe over it.

- Twitter

Same case as Facebook, although I scroll through my timeline once in a while. Just having one for the sake of having it, though my usual username is already taken by someone else.

- Instagram

I've been away from this platform for quite some time now, deactivated a couple of times in the past too. But, it seems the younger generations uses this as their "phone book" too since most new people I met asks me for one and it seems easier to just have it just for the sake of having it too.

- LinkedIn

Trying to be a little more active here, especially important to keep professional connections these days. Started posting my posts here to my LinkedIn page, quite grateful my course in 6th semester forces me to do this since I finally have something there.

- GitHub

I love Open Source, have I told you about that? I always try to find something to contribute on my free time, though I usually spend most of my free time working on my endless side projects. Come follow me and take a look at my GitHub account, this very website is Open Sourced too and this codebase lives in my GitHub account.

- GitLab

I haven't been as active on GitLab as I was in GitHub ever since Actions was introduced, perhaps it's too much for me to be active everywhere too. I mostly push to GitHub but in some cases I use GitLab too for some of the work-related ones.

- [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/ignatiusmb)

I don't have a specific genre that I must and will only listen to. I'm pretty open to all kinds of genre so I'll get along with any type. There's one label I've consistently followed since around 2015 I think, that is Monstercat. They're mainly an EDM label but not really the rave type of EDM which isn't really something I would listen to casually every day, but Monstercat releases are nice and they're release frequently so that's nice.

I started to categorize my music to songs I listen to on that month, the results are curated playlists of what I listened to each month and I try to make it unique by ending it after a new month starts and starts exploring for new songs. This way, I can see and relive what I did every year on each month just by playing the playlist I made for that month. I also did this because I miss a lot of my old songs that feels nostalgic to me but they're too many to search for and scattered all over the place, plus I've probably forgot most of the title to search for.

### YouTube Playlists

This links to my playlists tab in which I've collected videos I watched every day that's worthwhile, all grouped in their own playlist with each having one purpose.

- Curated Series - *Upcoming Page*

Curated series is just a playlist of the stuff that happens that month. A more detailed one which involves more than just a YouTube playlist where I break down everything that happens each month is in the Curated Page.

- Learning Series

Learning series is a playlist to help me remember something I've forgot. It's more of an insurance for the future if when I need that knowledge again or someone asks me for a reference.

- IMB Series

This is a more personalized playlist series. All playlist with the "IMB" prefix is made specifically for myself. Although it's personalized, I have 3 playlists here that I recommend to explore if you're rich on time or you'd like your mind to wander.

1. [Informative](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtthNj7yut57pdi5SlSm35eCdU6KsgxPG)

This playlist was created as a compilation of the things I find to be useful and practical to know about, videos that I feel everyone should know at least or have heard about it.

2. [TruAF](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtthNj7yut56UXDGVE4dDnvoUi3fQ9gLz)

This playlist was created out of the feeling that hits too close to home. Videos that we can feel relatable or we can agree to a degree. Some might say it's the ugly truth.

3. [Curiosity](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtthNj7yut57rjEP2KXPlQaK4-2F6tthf)

This playlist is perhaps the one you can relax to. Created just because I had too much time and felt like I need to explore new and obscure things.
