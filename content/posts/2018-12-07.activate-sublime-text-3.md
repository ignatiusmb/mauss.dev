title: Activate Sublime Text 3 with Free License
tags: tutorial
---

One of the most preferred text editor at this moment is **Sublime Text 3**. Used by many developers for various projects including website, software development, game design and many more. It is, in fact, one of the best text editors on the market right now. Not at all like Notepad++ which is free for all to download and install, Sublime Text offers free evaluation without License Key upon the first installation. The full functionality License Key costs about $80 at the time of writing this post and if you don't pay for a license Sublime won't lock you out but it will keep showing you their activation popup every now and then.

Some features in Sublime Text editor includes the ability to instantly switch between projects, this means you can edit two more different projects in the same window. It also enables split layouts which allows you to edit documents beside each other, or edit two areas in the one record. You can edit with the same number of lines and segments as you wish, view numerous screens by editing with various windows, and utilizing different parts in every window.

Sublime Text has the ability to install and use different color schemes as some designers feel comfortable working with different color schemes, one of my favorites is [Monokai Pro](https://www.monokai.pro/sublime-text/), which is free to use for unlimited time with activation pop-up showing every time you open Sublime. If you are familiar with working with Notepad++ because of the color scheme, Sublime Text has a similar color scheme which makes you feel like working with Notepad++. Another best feature of this text editor is that third-party plugins allow extending the features in the text editor.

## Outline & Focus

- Use Sublime Text 3 without any activation pop-up showing
