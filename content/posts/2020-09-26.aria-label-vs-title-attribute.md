The title attribute is read by screen readers, but so does aria-label. They seem to serve the same purpose, so what's the difference?

Title allows you to add a native tooltip on hover, so if you're not planning to make you own tooltip but needs or wants your element to have one, then add a title attribute. On the other hand, aria labels are supported by default and are used by screen readers. It's not to say that title isn't read by screen readers, but aria is the preferred choice for accessibility support.

The answer is to simply use both `aria-label` and `title` attribute if you need the tooltip, otherwise `aria-label` is the preferred choice for accessibility support, especially if your elements doesn't have any text content, like a linked icon for example.
