tags: tutorial, git
description: A commit message, if structured correctly and written properly could summarize a thousand changes into just a paragraph, or even a title.

This will be a quick and short post, so feel free to spare a minute to read how I summarize changes within my code, and what style guide I'm referring to.

```
~Style Guide
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

This will work for both commit messages and PR/MR titles. I've been following this style guide ever since I started writing my own library, check out [Aqua](https://aqua.mauss.dev) and [Scramble](https://scramble.js.org).

```
Feat: Add syntax highlighting
├──┘  └──────────┬──────────┘
│                │
│                └── Summary in present tense and imperative form.
│
└────── Type: Chore | Docs | Feat | Fix | Refactor | Style | Test.
```

Some people prefer to use lowercase characters for this, but I look at this as if it was a title, and it wouldn't make sense if you don't start a title with a capital letter, right? It's just what I'm used to, so this is what I write. I'm also using this style guide for naming my pull requests (PR) and merge requests (MR).

```
Feat: (new feature for the user, not for a build script)
Fix: (bug fix for the user, not a fix for build script)
Refactor: (refactoring production code; renaming a variable, etc.)
Docs: (changes to the documentation)
Chore: (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)
Style: (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no production code change)
Test: (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
```

Look up my references for more great examples!

It needs to be said, there are no right or wrong ways to write commit messages. Just like currencies or most things in this world, as long as the people agrees and accepts it as their currency, it will have its own value. The same goes for your commits, as long as you understand what the title means and what it changes, you can follow any style guides you want.
