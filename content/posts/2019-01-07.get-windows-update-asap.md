Ever read the news about another big Windows update about to come soon, then couple of months later another article showed up telling you that the big update has come and everyone is talking about it but you didn't seem to notice any change to your personal computer? Yeah, me too, and that is unfair. Especially, if you PC is more than capable to handle it or any update that Windows throws at it for the next couple of years.
