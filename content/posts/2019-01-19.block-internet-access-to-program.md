I'm sure some of you have come across a program that you use offline/locally but keeps popping-up boxes when you start them or insisting on updating itself automatically, just to find out that the updates are breaking some of the functionality you want. You might also be using a program with obnoxious ads that could be blocked with no internet. Well, you can actually block them from accessing the internet in the background.

## Objective

- Block any program from accessing the internet
