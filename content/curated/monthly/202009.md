Hey folks, welcome back to our monthly digest! This time, September was pretty slow with everything except the articles. As always, feel free to skip ahead to your preferred content by using the quick links provided above to jump to your the section.

## Article of the month

There's a whole lot of great articles this month, it's crazy! You should definitely check out the other mentions below because this month has some insanely good articles.

![Front-end are full-stack developers now](https://res.cloudinary.com/css-tricks/image/fetch/w_1200,q_auto,f_auto/https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/full-stack.jpg "[ooooops I guess weâ€™re* full-stack developers now](https://css-tricks.com/ooooops-i-guess-were-full-stack-developers-now/) by Chris Coyier")

This is actually a written version of Chris' talk from Jamstack Conf London in 2019. Although it's been a year since then, the material is still (or dare I say even more) relevant right now considering the rapid evolution of front-end JS frameworks and web development in general.

It's discussing on how JS is slowly taking back-end stuff for the front-end to handle. Stuff like site-level architecture / routing, state management + getting and mutating data, and a bunch of other tasks. That, in addition with needing to know Git, writing tests, caring about performance, making sites accessible, setting up basic deploy pipeline, etc.

### Honorable article mentions

- [[CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/thinking-about-power-usage-and-websites/)] Thinking About Power Usage and Websites

> If you do this in HTML it will consume 3Ã— energy but if you do it in JavaScript it will consume 10Ã—

Another amazing article from Chris Coyier about the digital costs on the planet and website energy consumption. It links [an article](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341123776_Investigating_the_Correlation_between_Performance_Scores_and_Energy_Consumption_of_Mobile_Web_Apps) that discovered a a statistically significant negative correlation between performance scores and the energy consumption of mobile web apps, implying that an increase of the performance score tend to lead to a decrease of energy consumption.

In other words, we as developers could contribute to the effort of decreasing global pollution from our energy consumption and help reduce global warming. There's a lot we could actually do, like use or build a more efficient web application and serve a smaller bundle to our users, or write and use a more efficient algorithm to reduce power consumption from computing tasks, or just simply use dark mode and reduce the display power draw.

- [[CSS-IRL](https://css-irl.info/why-i-dont-have-time-for-your-coding-challenge/)] Why I Don't Have Time For Your Coding Challenge

A great article by Michelle Barker explaining why she doesn't do coding challenges from the perspective of an interviewee. The article describes why it's a waste of time and counter-productive, and instead offered alternatives other than doing coding challenges.

- [[CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/how-css-perspective-works/)] How CSS Perspective Works

I was quite certain that this would be the highlight for the article of this month, but man there's really a lot of good ones that come out midway through the month. But, it doesn't mean that this is less than the others mentioned. This article by Amit Sheen really opened my mind on how perspective in CSS works, it taught me a lot to come up with a new layout I've implemented in [Reviews](reviews).

It's a well-written article with good examples for me to learn and understand how it works, enough to implement it on my own. You should definitely check it out, especially if you're a front-end developer. It might not seem important right now, but you never know what ideas might pop up in your mind after you've learned about this, or you might finally figure out how to do that one layout you've been meaning to try since forever.

## Content of the month

![The God of High School banner](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/bhPDfwKeRklEfeOgNzbbz0tUggq.jpg "[[TMDB](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/bhPDfwKeRklEfeOgNzbbz0tUggq.jpg)] The God of High School")

The God of High School just aired their final episode for Season 1 on 28th of August and it was amazing. A manhwa adaptation with full-throttle action-packed episodes. I need to compare this to Tower of God, since they're both a webtoon turned anime, and because it was quite a letdown for me. Although the story is where it shines, there's really no action in Tower of God and when there is, it ends in with just a move. It left me unsatisfied even though I still enjoy going through the story.

Meanwhile, The God of High School seems to fill in all the missing pieces Tower of God left me and felt like the complete opposite of it. It's as if this show was made just to flex on their fighting scenes, each punches and kicks feels like it's taken straight from a real martial arts fights, and every fight scene is so well choreographed and beautifully animated. I'm not saying the story is bad, but it might seem too fast for some people's taste. Anyways, it's still an amazing show nonetheless, regardless of the story's pace.
