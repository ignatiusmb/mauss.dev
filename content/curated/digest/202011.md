## Music of the month

![!YouTube#hb](qU-181e-hSw "[[Spotify](spotify:track:7DTk1207Efq0HBUEYmbcTB)] Stonebank - Scared")

Another awesome release from Stonebank (a.k.a. StoneDank because the releases are always Dank). Not to mention the genre is Drum and Bass (DnB), one of my favorites in the EDM scope.

There's also a lot of amazing mixes released this month, be sure to check them out in the new YouTube Music playlist down below.

### Honorable music mentions | [Spotify](spotify:playlist:3u52u0faYK0uLQz5wgL7k3) / [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtthNj7yut551MwQsLcNFs8kL5guFzDPY)

![!YouTube#d](IVQkcd706-4 "[[Spotify](spotify:track:1St4foaXsAX3vvkXXRA0l2)] EBEN - My Decree (feat. Micah Martin)")

Awesome song with amazing vocals by Micah Martin. With psyched up Mob as the background, it gives off such vibes that gets you all pumped up.

![!YouTube#d](S1CaLdzwuU4 "[[Spotify](spotify:track:2raUfi0wM6gDa3RDKNQySD)] Tristam - Violence")

I think [this meme](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monstercat/comments/jlx7ru/meme_everyone_hearing_violence_for_the_first_time/) from the community describes everyone who knew about Tristam well. It was such a great feeling when I first saw it, and it's also a great release.

![!YouTube#d](TYxzSjAABng "[[Spotify](spotify:track:10r998Pph8xlvZ9eUKz4mD)] MUZZ - Somewhere Else (feat. Danyka Nadeau)")

Another worthy mention to MUZZ and Danyka Nadeau latest release, Somewhere Else. Such a great song and animations, it's shocking how far Monstercat releases has improved over the time.

## Headlines of the month

### Kick Google Play Outside Your Smartphone With AuroraStore

Built to truly be an alternative to Google Play Store (and not something like F-Droid). This is perfect for you who wanted to start your privacy-focused journey. AuroraStore is easy to install and includes both apps and games, just like Play Store does.

Source(s): [[FOSS Post](https://fosspost.org/aurorastore-google-play-alternative/)]

### PSA: Your Public Domain Is Part of Your Infrastructure and Not Just Your Homepage

The post itself describes it well in a form of rant. Generally, don't do anything with your domain without consulting your IT, don't even give keys or access to others, especially telling "web guys" to cancel "that old homepage".

Source(s): [[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/jm2iu3/psa_your_public_domain_is_part_of_your/)]

### Your Phone Number May Be Readily Available to Anyone if You Play Genshin Impact

The forgot password feature can be used to show your phone number to anyone, if you linked a mobile number to your account. Email would be partially censored, but not the phone number. This seems to be fixed now, but we don't know how many phone numbers were exposed publicly.

### Google Photos will end its free unlimited storage on June 1st, 2021

The time has finally come for Google to kill one of it's products again, this time it's their unlimited photos service. With almost everyone I knew using Google Photos to back up all of the photos since the beginning of time, most people have now found a way to download and archive all of it using tools across the internet. It was a good run, I personally didn't use it because I don't like my photos compressed, so I still keep it there but with the original option checked, so everything counts towards my quota.

### Flappy bird in 341 bytes of URI formatted HTML and JavaScript

One madman created an entirely playable Flappy Bird in 341 bytes of HTML and JavaScript encoded as URI. As of writing this, the community has tried to reduce it even more and it stands at less than 200 bytes, 195 bytes to be exact.
