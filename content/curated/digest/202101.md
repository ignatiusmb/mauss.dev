## Content of the month

![Demon Slayer Mugen Train#f#fb](https://www.themoviedb.org/t/p/original/xoqr4dMbRJnzuhsWDF3XNHQwJ9x.jpg "[[TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/t/p/original/xoqr4dMbRJnzuhsWDF3XNHQwJ9x.jpg)] Demon Slayer: Infinity Train | [See Review](reviews?q=Demon+Slayer+Mugen+Train)")

This is a given. You know this is coming, this was the highlight of January 2021. A great way to start the year is to definitely watch this! It's popularity is on-par with Spirited Away and Your Name. If you haven't watched the first season, I highly recommend you do so. If you have, the what are you waiting for.

\*Note that you can't really see this without watching the first season of Demon Slayer since this movie is a direct continuation of the first season.

### Honorable content mentions

![!YouTube-s#d](PLZRRxQcaEjA4qyEuYfAMCazlL0vQDkIj2 "[[IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6439562/)] Mind Field: Season 1")

I've finished the first season last December, and this isn't quite fair to the show because it's such an amazing series, so putting it as an honorable mention doesn't really represent the whole series. But, I've only watched the first one and haven't seen the next seasons, so I'll put it here for this month's digest.

![!YouTube#d](d9ak52ZVL5k "[[MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/anime/38295/Joshikausei)] Joshikausei")

A short slice of life series consisting of 12 3-min episodes. With absolutely no dialogue, Joshikausei tells a story about the every day life of 3 high school girls by only using expressions and their actions. It isn't like the classics, say *Tom and Jerry* or *Pink Panther* level, but I still enjoy it nevertheless since it's not something you see often in a form of Anime. There's also a lot of fan service, if you're into that kind of stuff. Aside from that, their comedy amusing enough and the whole series is available on YouTube (dropdown video above) in one-sitting for 35 minutes, so there's not really much to lose.

## Music of the month

![!YouTube#hb](TsWiuqzhtis "[[Spotify](spotify:track:61wLzCC9mT2goJ88deGPx0)] Tristam - Children in the Dark")

A release from Tristam never seems to disappoint, with such beautiful vocals, melody, and lyrics, *Children in the Dark* easily takes the spot for this month's featured music. Just kidding, it wasn't that easy, but I've certainly come to like this the more I listened to it.

![!YouTube#d](vcGbefQBvJ4 "[[Spotify](spotify:track:465JzFiajJO59sUrDFsxdC)] YOASOBI„Äå„Ç¢„É≥„Ç≥„Éº„É´„Äç(Encore)")

YOASOBI is on a roll this January and it truly makes this much harder. I can't possibly give all the spots for their releases, so here's one of the best that I enjoyed. It's also bundled with THE BOOK and makes this their first exclusive album release (not a single). This preview is what hypes me up when I first listened to the trailer, and it delivers well.

![!YouTube#d](G8GaQdW2wHc "[[Spotify](spotify:track:0CnpSTdL9l5vQM4YnzXtyo)] IZ*ONE (ÏïÑÏù¥Ï¶àÏõê) 'Panorama' MV")

This is (from what I heard) the last release IZ*ONE will produce, they'll be disbanded (end of contract) after this. But for their final release, it was really amazing, especially the MV. They must've put a lot of time and effort for this and it really shows in the video.

![!YouTube#d](YpzpvemfhtA "[[Spotify](spotify:track:4BrYTZfpZzeNAGbJ7kh2Z0)] inverness - State of Wonder (feat. Anthony Russo & KANG DANIEL)")

Monstercat has a lot of artists lately and it's quite hard to keep track of all of them, but this is one of those release that sticks to your ear. An Instinct release, this brings back a lot of memories when I first discovered Future Bass.

## Video of the month

![!YouTube#hb](PKtnafFtfEo "MrBeast's Youtube Rewind 2020")

If you haven't subscribed to this man, where have you been and what are you doing all this time? Go subscribe to the best YouTube philanthropist out there! This is probably a must watch for all YouTube geeks (or just anyone actually).

### Honorable video mentions | [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtthNj7yut57WLW3GoLqbR_vTzTk72Hcb)

![!YouTube#d](p8u_k2LIZyo "Fast Inverse Square Root ‚Äî A Quake III Algorithm")

This one's for all programmer geeks out here. One of the best well-explained video of an absurd algorithm from an old game that really makes you think about how you're going to use any of the stuff that you learn and actually use it like this.

![!YouTube#d](dALZLB_W8Lc "The Japanese myth of the trickster raccoon")

I've been watching Mushi-shi lately and I love every single episode of it. Whether it's a myth or others, Japanese stories are always cool and insightful. This myth is also one of them, if you knew more of these please tell me.

![!YouTube#d](xbGno-3jEJs "Every shoe store be like")

**LLS** finally delivers another video and most of them from this video hits too close to home. These skits are humorous and aren't harmful like most "pranks" these days. Most of their other videos are also fun to watch so definitely check them out when you don't have much to do.
