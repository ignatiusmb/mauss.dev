![!YouTube#hb](vd3IlOjSUGQ "[[Spotify](spotify:track:6wKmxUeMJAoz2GpMrw95z5)] YOASOBI„Äå„Éè„É´„Ç´„Äç (Haruka)")

Another amazing release from YOASOBI! This was an unexpectedly welcomed release to close the year. I love the vocals so much and it has a catchy beat too. I might be a little bit biased at this point, but if you love the previous releases, you'll definitely love this as well.

![!YouTube#d](Y4nEEZwckuU "[[Spotify](spotify:track:0T4AitQuq8IJhWBWuZwkFA)] YOASOBI„ÄåÁæ§Èùí„Äç (Ultramarine)")

Ultramarine finally got an official MV! I might've only mentioned it before but this is worth checking out again.

![!YouTube#d](LJBHySglLXU "[[YouTube/NetflixAnime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5M4lbEpn6c)] YOASOBI „ÄéÊÄ™Áâ©„Äè (Kaibutsu) / BEASTARS Season 2 OP")

Another YOASOBI release, yes I know. This might seem excessive and it's not even a full song. But, I'm really interested in watching the series just from this OP. It's only one and a half minute, go check it out for yourself.

![!YouTube#d](H8bgjgZu3Ww "[[Spotify](spotify:track:3CExJpkcpoKeu1ETWlgT8B)] Slippy & Danyka Nadeau - Resonate")

Might just be another bias, but every Slippy release are always a banger. While we're on the topic of Monstercat, the OG artists are back with banger remixes. Even PBN did a remix of another song, which is unheard of.
