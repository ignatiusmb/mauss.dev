## Music of the month

![!YouTube#hb](vd3IlOjSUGQ "[[Spotify](spotify:track:6wKmxUeMJAoz2GpMrw95z5)] YOASOBI„Äå„Éè„É´„Ç´„Äç (Haruka)")

Another amazing release from YOASOBI! This was an unexpectedly welcomed release to close the year. I love the vocals so much and it has a catchy beat too. I might be a little bit biased at this point, but if you love the previous releases, you'll definitely love this as well.

![!YouTube#d](Y4nEEZwckuU "[[Spotify](spotify:track:0T4AitQuq8IJhWBWuZwkFA)] YOASOBI„ÄåÁæ§Èùí„Äç (Ultramarine)")

Ultramarine finally got an official MV! I might've only mentioned it before but this is worth checking out again.

![!YouTube#d](LJBHySglLXU "[[YouTube/NetflixAnime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5M4lbEpn6c)] YOASOBI „ÄéÊÄ™Áâ©„Äè (Kaibutsu) / BEASTARS Season 2 OP")

Another YOASOBI release, yes I know. This might seem excessive and it's not even a full song. But, I'm really interested in watching the series just from this OP. It's only one and a half minute, go check it out for yourself.

![!YouTube#d](H8bgjgZu3Ww "[[Spotify](spotify:track:3CExJpkcpoKeu1ETWlgT8B)] Slippy & Danyka Nadeau - Resonate")

Might just be another bias, but every Slippy release are always a banger. While we're on the topic of Monstercat, the OG artists are back with banger remixes. Even PBN did a remix of another song, which is unheard of.

## Video of the month

![!YouTube#hb](8PyiA7o8LLE "Honobono Log")

I'm not sure how I've just discovered this, but wow is it such a nice series to watch. I probably won't always remember this, but when you do stumble upon it again, it really gives off a nostalgic feeling as when you first watched it. This is the complete series as one video, if you prefer to watch by parts, go search it for yourself, I think it's complete in YouTube.

![!YouTube#d](dBap_Lp-0oc "The Illusion You Need To See")

Veritasium ending the year with a crazy illusion anyone absolutely needs to see! I really tried to focus and it works, but man is it tiring and my brain will immediately see the illusion again if I lose focus for just a bit. Definitely worth the watch!

![!YouTube#d](fb3cvohPsRY "Animation is For Everyone")

Yes. Yes. Yes. For you who hasn't opened your mind (and eye) that animation is not for you (or only for kids), please treat yourself by watching this. I might make a dedicated post for this too, but in the meantime MB has explained it pretty well and convincing in this video. I used to be on the denial-train that I don't need to watch animations, but once I learn and actually tried it for myself... I'll explain it more thoroughly in the post. ^-^

![!YouTube#d](-92HQA0GcI8 "Inside the Lab That Invented the COVID-19 Vaccine")

Considering we're still in the middle of a global pandemic, there's no harm in understanding how a Coronavirus spreads and attack its host. I feel this video has explained it nicely, even for those who didn't study science in high school to understand it well. It also explains how the vaccine is made, and how it works.
