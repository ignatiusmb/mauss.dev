## Article of the month

![Code Review#f#fb](https://mtlynch.io/code-review-love/cover.png "[How to Make Your Code Reviewer Fall in Love with You](https://mtlynch.io/code-review-love/) by Michael Lynch")

> When people talk about code reviews, they focus on the reviewer. But the developer who writes the code is just as important to the review as the person who reads it.

Code review isn't just about the reviewer's work and job, it is the whole team's job. The post mentions to value your reviewer's time, but this applies to everyone and not just the reviewer. By improving your code that are being reviewed, you're also improving yourself as well as your experience overall.

TL;DR review the code yourself first and automate stuff that can be automated, that way your reviewer can give you high-quality feedback to improve yourself and reduce the workloads for both of you (and probably the whole team waiting for that PR to merge).

### Honorable article mentions

- [[PrivacyTools](https://write.privacytools.io/freddy/why-privacy-matters-even-if-you-have-nothing-to-hide)] Privacy matters even if "you have nothing to hide"

I wanted this to be the featured article, but it's a short post without a thumbnail, sorry üòï. But this is still a great read nonetheless! The idea of hiding is fundamentally flawed, and we should strive to revive everyone that privacy is a human right. Having it breached everyday shouldn't be a norm. To quote from the post...

> We all care about our privacy, though we might not know it. It is why we lock the door when we go to the toilet; or why we close the curtains to stop people looking into our homes.

There shouldn't be an argument for protecting our privacy in the first place anyway! Next time someone asks why they should care, asks them back if they want everyone that passes in front of their house to look inside the glass windows? There's nothing to hide in the house, right? Yet, there's curtains to cover the windows.

- [[UX Collective](https://uxdesign.cc/creating-randomness-with-pure-css-a990dafcd569)] Creating randomness with pure CSS

Another mind-blowing technique using pure CSS. I can't of anything useful to use this other than for simple online games, in the meantime. But, just knowing that this is possible is so amazing and fun.

- [[Swizec](https://swizec.com/blog/computer-science-is-not-software-engineering)] Computer science is not software engineering

> Wow, college was such a waste of time ... when did you ever invert a binary tree outside of an interview?

Honestly, please tell me if you really did. On the other hand, this post is a fair assessment, perhaps a little too much on the rambling. But, you should know what it's talking about, especially as someone who studied Computer Science. Others who took the *software development* track on college would probably understand too.

## Content of the month

### Honorable content mentions

## Music of the month

![!YouTube#hb](vd3IlOjSUGQ "[[Spotify](spotify:track:6wKmxUeMJAoz2GpMrw95z5)] YOASOBI„Äå„Éè„É´„Ç´„Äç (Haruka)")

Another amazing release from YOASOBI! This was an unexpectedly welcomed release to close the year. I love the vocals so much and it has a catchy beat too. I might be a little bit biased at this point, but if you love the previous releases, you'll definitely love this as well.

### Honorable music mentions | [Spotify](spotify:playlist:5kV8nVYgylds5wxuVGuctC) / [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtthNj7yut55qVn14CrIoYAWQ5y7Pw8td)

![!YouTube#d](Y4nEEZwckuU "[[Spotify](spotify:track:0T4AitQuq8IJhWBWuZwkFA)] YOASOBI„ÄåÁæ§Èùí„Äç (Ultramarine)")

Ultramarine finally got an official MV! I might've only mentioned it before but this is worth checking out again.

![!YouTube#d](LJBHySglLXU "[[YouTube/NetflixAnime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5M4lbEpn6c)] YOASOBI „ÄéÊÄ™Áâ©„Äè (Kaibutsu) / BEASTARS Season 2 OP")

Another YOASOBI release, yes I know. This might seem excessive and it's not even a full song. But, I'm really interested in watching the series just from this OP. It's only one and a half minute, go check it out for yourself.

![!YouTube#d](H8bgjgZu3Ww "[[Spotify](spotify:track:3CExJpkcpoKeu1ETWlgT8B)] Slippy & Danyka Nadeau - Resonate")

Might just be another bias, but every Slippy release are always a banger. While we're on the topic of Monstercat, the OG artists are back with banger remixes. Even PBN did a remix of another song, which is unheard of.

## Video of the month

![!YouTube#hb](8PyiA7o8LLE "Honobono Log")

I'm not sure how I've just discovered this, but wow is it such a nice series to watch. I probably won't always remember this, but when you do stumble upon it again, it really gives off a nostalgic feeling as when you first watched it. This is the complete series as one video, if you prefer to watch by parts, go search it for yourself, I think it's complete in YouTube.

### Honorable video mentions | [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtthNj7yut574E71vVR0sYZ14qWQS-eYb)

![!YouTube#d](dBap_Lp-0oc "The Illusion You Need To See")

Veritasium ending the year with a crazy illusion anyone absolutely needs to see! I really tried to focus and it works, but man is it tiring and my brain will immediately see the illusion again if I lose focus for just a bit. Definitely worth the watch!

![!YouTube#d](fb3cvohPsRY "Animation is For Everyone")

Yes. Yes. Yes. For you who hasn't opened your mind (and eye) that animation is not for you (or only for kids), please treat yourself by watching this. I might make a dedicated post for this too, but in the meantime MB has explained it pretty well and convincing in this video. I used to be on the denial-train that I don't need to watch animations, but once I learn and actually tried it for myself... I'll explain it more thoroughly in the post. ^-^

![!YouTube#d](-92HQA0GcI8 "Inside the Lab That Invented the COVID-19 Vaccine")

Considering we're still in the middle of a global pandemic, there's no harm in understanding how a Coronavirus spreads and attack its host. I feel this video has explained it nicely, even for those who didn't study science in high school to understand it well. It also explains how the vaccine is made, and how it works.

## Headlines of the month

### Attack on Titan Final Season is MyAnimeList's Biggest Premiere Ever

With 144,668 people watching the premiere of its first episode, it broke the previous record holder from My Hero Academia Season 3 by a margin of nearly 40,000. Keep in mind that this is only the recorded amount in MyAnimeList, the actual viewers watching all around the world are way higher.

![MAL Biggest Premieres#d#f](https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire4/52b7bb0aee433aa9a2a4e2c7c4bae4f51607957218_main.jpg "MyAnimeList Biggest Premieres Chart")

If you haven't watched or caught up with the series, there's still time to catch up with the ongoing final season. If you're not convinced yet by the number of people watching the first episode, maybe [Crunchyroll servers collapsing](https://twitter.com/Crunchyroll/status/1335692289427918848) would.

### Cloudflare has joined the battle

After releasing their privacy-first Web Analytics to the world early this month that would compete heavily with Google analytics, they released another product later on called Pages. With Cloudflare Pages, they will competing with Netlify and Vercel head-on to provide an alternative to build Jamstack apps, especially with their well-known worldwide servers for minimal latency and heavy Workers integrations for serverless functions.
