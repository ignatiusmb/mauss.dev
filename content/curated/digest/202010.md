## Article of the month

![Tracking without JavaScript#f#fb](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*5AecJjiH3Z50F_BfOIaEYw.png "[User-Tracking With CSS Only](https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/tracking-with-css-ec98e3d81046) by Louis Petrik")

This was surprisingly cool and scary at the same time. It's crazy, how are you supposed to prevent tracking you've disabled everything, including JavaScript, and the website still tracks you using CSS that's loaded almost at the same time as the markup. You'll need to prepare your own server with all the endpoints and manually include it in the CSS, but still there's nothing stopping them from tracking everything.

### Honorable article mentions

- [[CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/the-widening-responsibility-for-front-end-developers/)] The Widening Responsibility for Front-End Developers

Another great read from Chris Coyier for an evolution of last month's article of the month. For all of you who's going to jump in the web development rabbit hole, especially as a front-end developer (FED), please read this first and understand it thoroughly.

FED isn't just styling and creating layouts in HTML and CSS, it's not as easy or simple as you might've thought initially, there's a lot more to it, a lot of demand for FED and you will need to live up to the expectations.

For those who've dived in this pool and are still in, I encourage you even more to read this and know what kind of work you're actually working and expected to work as you dive deeper. It's not too late to go a different route if this doesn't suit you. No one will blame you for the choice you made.

I'm not trying to scare you away from becoming a FED, but you have all the rights to know what's expected from this field. Especially when everything is always rapidly changing and growing, do you want to spend the rest of your life learning new things every few months?

Yes, technology is always evolving, but front-end's growth is too rapid with only months or weeks between major updates. Pair that with all the prerequisites you still need to understand first, how much of a preparations you need to know before you can actually work on something.

You cannot stop and you must not stop. Once you're in, you must go through it till the end. Front-end will keep evolving and they will leave you behind if you can't keep up. Do you have what it takes to follow it through? If so, then **Godspeed to you**

- [[Troy Hunt](https://www.troyhunt.com/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know/)] Everything you ever wanted to know about building a secure password reset feature

An amazing article written from 2012 which is still relevant today. I can't say much about this since it already explains most of my worries from applications out there in the article. It has a [TL;DR version in a diagram form](https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2016/02/21782177Password-Reset5.png) too.

## Headlines of the month

### One-Hundredth

### Minecraft caves and cliffs update announced

This themed update was a surprise to most of the players. It shook the community and made them go crazy because this theme is perhaps one of the most requested themes for the major updates. A game company that actually listens to its users, can you believe it?!?

![Minecraft caves and cliffs update#f](https://i.redd.it/cdbwq7mykwq51.png "Source: [Reddit](https://i.redd.it/cdbwq7mykwq51.png)")

It will come in Summer 2021, still a couple of months to go, but it has changed and impacted a lot of creators and players on how they play the game, especially redstone users.

### RIP HorribleSubs - welcoming SubsPlease as a better replacement

HorribleSubs was a well renowned name in the anime community since forever. They've started more than a decade ago and has been consistently providing us with the latest and fastest anime airing on the time. Early October 2020, just as Summer 2020 anime season ended, they decided to officially close down their service, a good transition point before Fall 2020 season starts. A couple of days later, SubsPlease emerged to fill in the missing throne HS has left for us.

### RIP Sapper - Svelte is moving to Snowpack

Rich Harris finally announced on Svelte Summit 2020 that Sapper 1.0 will never come. It was a sad day for me personally as I've used it extensively in most of my projects. He explained that the future of web development would be moving to a better more future proof alternative.

He's trying to convince us that we need to drop bundlers from our ecosystem and embrace HMR. It was quite a surprise for myself, but truly a welcome one. Using HMR will definitely boost our development process and experience a lot, but I didn't think that they would abandon Sapper and create an entirely new project instead.
