### RIP Sapper, Svelte is moving to Snowpack

Sapper is the official framework for Svelte to build full-fledged applications with the ability to do SSR or SSG and be an SPA all together.

On Sunday night (or Monday morning my time), 18 October 2018 at Svelte Summit 2020, Rich Harris (original creator) announced that Sapper 1.0 will never be coming. He explained that the future of web development would be moving to a better more future proof alternative.

Svelte would have SSR built-in and will rely more on Hot-Module Reload (HMR) by using Snowpack, rather than the conventional way of bundling everything up, which slows down development a lot. In return, the team have started working on `@sveltejs/kit` as a replacement for Sapper with a bundler and have ported most of the good stuff from Sapper to this new kit.

Of course, it's by no means ready for prime time, the team still has a lot of plans to improve before they release it to the public. Yes, it's still in private development, so it's not open to public contributions, yet. In the mean time, I don't expect Sapper to immediately "die" and stop all future developments, I'm certain there will be someone who will still work on it and continue its legacy, keep improving and maintaining its codebase, it is open-source after all.

Personally, I'm really sad to see that HMR isn't coming to Sapper because I first started with Sapper and learned Svelte by building Sapper apps. So, you could also guess that I've made most of my apps with Sapper. I guess all good things must come to an end, and I'm sure that this would be a way better solution in the future, but I'll probably need some time to take this in.
