## Verdict

It doesn't hit you all at once, the understatement devastates you over the course of a week or more as you make the sad connections. You're simply haunted by the film, it's layers of sad.

## $SPOILERS

The movie is based on an autobiographical novel. The author, with enormous guilt over providing for himself first rather than his sister, has stated he prefers the movie because he is allowed to die at the end. It portrays him a lot more positively than what happened in real life.

What happens IRL? He hoarded food and kept it for himself. But, the way he explains it sounds more like he ate them in panic during a time when food was scarce. He was only 15 at the time, and I can't expect anyone at that age to respond well in war too, and he wasn't stocking those food in the bunker and hiding them from his sister, he ate them immediately.
