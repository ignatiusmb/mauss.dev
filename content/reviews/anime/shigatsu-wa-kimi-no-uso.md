## Synopsis

Kousei Arima the prodigious pianist, also called the human metronome that never misses a beat, falls into a downward spiral after the passing of his mother, rendering him unable to hear the sound of his own piano tunes (more info in spoilers section).

Two years later, after living in a monochrome world, his life changes drastically as he meets Kaori Miyazono, a beautiful and audacious violinist who stirs up his world and drags him back on a journey to face music again with his piano. Together with his childhood friends, Tsubaki Sawabe and Ryouta Watari, he's starting to get back on his feet, and time that was once frozen started ticking again for him.

Based on the manga series of the same name, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso approaches the story of Kousei's recovery as he discovers that music is more than playing each note perfectly, and a single melody can bring in the fresh spring air of April.

## Highlights

### $#{rating:0}#!/10 | Story & Plot

The story makes sense, it's not over the top, it's not cliche either. Pretty predictable in a way, but it's written better than most drama love story I've encountered before. In short, it's original in its own way.

It's mostly sad but they always try to follow up with something humorous to cover it up, but when it doesn't, it really hits hard. It's perhaps the definition of riding a rollercoaster of emotions. The plot is well managed too, it guides you from the beginning to the end smoothly and explains the story in a well-managed manner.

### $#{rating:1}#!/10 | Artwork & Animation

As expected of A-1 Pictures, great as always. Always been a fan of their works, and this is without a doubt one of them. My only complaints are when they only put a static image of with sound when a side character is performing. Aside from that, it's scenes and backgrounds, especially when the performance is on, is absolutely beautiful.

### $#{rating:2}#!/10 | Sound

I have no complaints about the sound here. It's a no-brainer for me, I love to listen to music and this show is dedicated to performing one. I love to listen classical music, it's not really the listen-to-everyday kind of music, but if you don't, fear not. The way they present it to you in this show is nice that you don't really get bored by listening to it throughout the show. The opening and ending sequence are super nice too that I never skip.

### $#{rating:3}#!/10 | Characters

The characters are well-built. True to the nature of the genre, they're humans, and they're relatable as such. Their character development is visible and they makes us feel like we grew together with them.

Some minor things I'll be picky about is they sometimes exaggerate some of the character's trait too much to a point that it becomes tedious and repetitive.

## Verdict

Your Lie in April was certainly that kind of show where you knew what's going to happen in the end, yet you'll still be "surprised" by it. It's that type of slice of life, drama anime  you'll most likely just enjoy watching or re-watching.

The title itself makes me think about it constantly throughout the series, trying to figure out who's perspective is "Your Lie" coming from and what lie is about. I highly suggest you **don't go wiki surfing and just watch it** till the end as is. I always felt like that's the best approach to watch a series, the journey and experience of growing with the characters is worthwhile by itself.

The final verdict from me is of course, highly recommended! You can watch it anytime you'd like, but by the time you're done, you'll probably want to re-watch it around April.

## $SPOILERS

There's not much to break down here since they pretty much explains everything in the final episode. But, that doesn't mean there's nothing left to discuss. Here's some of the things I find quite interesting and worth to talk about.

### Kousei Arima illness

The human mind is truly a fragile thing, and what Kousei experienced was real, it shouldn't be taken lightly and definitely not something to be ignored or brushed off. It may not seem like it, but Kousei actually experienced an extreme form of mental scarring that develops a mental illness in him called post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). He was truly suffering as a person after his mother's death. [Explained more thoroughly here](https://aminoapps.com/c/anime/page/blog/kousei-arima-the-struggle-of-ptsd/08tk_uKPrGbKX0dNxwn71BBop7BZ5q)

Him not being able to hear his own piano tones might seem absurd and his vision of himself playing in the bottom of a deep dark waters may also be called an exaggeration. But, those image that he had represents a real world disease, [tone deafness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusia#Congenital_amusia). Also called **congenital amusia**, or perhaps in Kousei's case it was **acquired amusia**, amusia meaning the loss of ability to produce or recognize musical sounds.

### Kaori Miyazono illness

> A single petal that drifted into my life

A metaphor used by Kousei to describe Kaori who appeared out of nowhere and then disappeared due to how fragile she was.

The show strongly hinted a similarity between Kaori and Saki (Kousei's deceased mother) illness, but it's probably there for the sake of the plot to re-trigger Kousei's trauma.

However, judging by her symptoms, it is hypothesized that Kaori suffers from either one of these

- [Bone marrow failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow_failure)
- [Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis)
- [Friedreich's Ataxia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedreich%27s_ataxia)

It's more likely to be Friedreich's Ataxia, judging from the symptoms that begins between the age of 5 to 15, muscle weakness in the arms and legs, and loss of coordination. It also causes heart disorders, which she may be experiencing in episode 20.

A surgery to "prolong" her life may just be to implant a pacemaker since she may be having a severe and painful tachycardia previously, but we saw her heartbeat drop steadily during the surgery, which might be the cause of another cardiac arrest.

### Final Scene

- Kousei performs *Chopin`s Ballade No. 1 in G minor, Op. 23* at the competition while Kaori undergoes surgery.
- As he plays, he enters into a dream-like state, surrounded by color and light with Kaori and her violin appearing before him. Kousei immediately realize that her surgery was unsuccessful as he played along with her. This scene also presents the last promise they made to play together again.
- As the play is nearing the end, she started to disappear steadily and he begs her to stay with him, she then disappears with one last tearful smile.
- In reality, Kousei completes his performance with tears running down his face, saying his final farewell to her, just like he did previously with his mother.

After receiving her letter, Kousei finally knows that Kaori loved him and reaffirms his vow to never forget her, continuing to play the piano. Her intentions from the beginning may not be for Kousei to love her back since she realizes that she doesn't have a lot of time left, however she insisted on doing what she claims to be the things she won't end up regretting in the end, and one of them was to be part of Kousei's life.

**Side Note**: Kaori claims that Watari was an amazing friend but will probably forget all about her. However, it's visually suggested that he really did like her. This is supported by the scene where we can see him picks up his phone and looks at their picture together, and Kaori is likely the one who scolds Watari and slaps him in the scene, hence her believing he'll probably forget about her and move on to another girl quickly.

### Title Origin

I thought I've figured it out when Kaori said this in episode 5 (Gray Skies)

> We're all just faking it, some of us better than others, but you put your music on the stand and play anyhow because that's the way **you tell the most beautiful lie** of them all.

Well, it was a surprise when it turns out that it wasn't what the title was talking about. It was a welcome one though, it wouldn't be fun if the viewers had figured it that early in the show.

*Your Lie in April* wasn't describing the scene from Kaori's perspective (which is what I thought at first), but instead from Kousei's.

- "April" as a phrase used to describe Kaori which exists in spring (April).
- "Your Lie" being Kaori's lie she told at the last episode.
- "Your Lie in April" being used to remind Kousei to never forget Kaori, to never press the "reset" button every year when spring comes, the season when he met her for the first time.

> Spring will be here soon. The season I met you is almost here. A spring without you will arrive.
