![Yosuga no Sora Backdrop](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/haeBJjV2JHfopKl4dYE7RJwASlF.jpg "Sky of Connection")

## Synopsis

After losing both their parents to a car accident and being orphaned, they left the city life and sold their apartment. Haruka "Haru" Kasugano with his fraternal twin sister Sora "Sora" Kasugano, travel to the countryside and start life anew at their grandparent's house, where they used to spend their summer holidays.

They met a lot of their childhood friends back when they were still kids. Haruka didn't remember at first, but as the story develops, he remembers his memories of the past where he used to play with a lot of his childhood friends at the village.

## Plot

Yosuga no Sora was originally a game (2008) that was adapted to a manga (2009) and eventually into an anime (2010). Based off an adult visual novel, this anime adaption follows quite an unusual approach where it is presented in a **multi-arc** branching format that **independently** tells the story of Haruka as the main lead with 4 different girls in 4 different arcs.

It's pretty reasonable for every girl to have their own story considering this was made from a visual novel, there's even some from the game that didn't get their own story in the anime, but they're still here as a supporting role.

Each arc is its own story with independent plot and should not be confused with one another. Episode 1 is the only episode where all the story happens together, it serves as a starting point for 4 of the story which first diverges on episode 2 and 7 respectively. You can refer to the flowchart above.

Yosuga no Sora finishes after only 1 season of 12 episodes. Each episode consists of a 22 minutes feature segment and a 3 minutes omake segment. The bonus segment focuses on Motoka's story that is continuous between episode 1 to 12. So you could say that the bonus segment is the only linear plot line here.

In total, there's 5 endings, 4 as the main storyline and another one in the extras.

## Highlights

This is **not a hentai**, if you're going in on this with that mindset, you're better off watching something else. There is of course some sexual scenes, but it is served reasonably for the story to progress and has deeper meanings with **how they got into it** and not just there for the sake of something sexual.

### 4/10 | Story & Plot

Originally coming from a game, you won't be bored by the lack of content and useless fillers. Even though I appreciate its uniqueness by having the plot executed like a game with a save point to experience all the paths, I feel it's a lot of wasted potential and it could've felt better with just a linear plot.

The story is interesting and I was kinda into it after episode 3. But, I didn't know better at the time and was confused why it repeated itself on the 4th episode. It's pretty generic and predictable for most parts.

The first couple of endings were pretty generic and boring too, and the last one isn't really that satisfying either. But, I do still appreciate and enjoyed this regardless.

### 7/10 | Artwork & Animation

For a show released on 2010, it felt quite timeless and was done beautifully. Backgrounds are colorful and vivid with good attention to details. The characters are well designed, Haruka as the main male character which is a kind guy with quirks that makes females find him cute and handsome.

Each characters, especially the girls are portrayed differently, each with their own unique and memorable style that is easy to remember.

### 10/10 | Sound

I absolutely love the soundtracks composed here, albeit a bit repetitive in some cases. I would agree if some would say they're being lazy by overusing one track for all the (attempted) sad or happy moments. But, I guess it's more of how they delivered it.

Regardless of all of that, objectively speaking of the sounds alone, I really enjoyed it. It was the one thing I immediately noticed to be spectacular. I didn't know what I expected when I first got into it, but a couple of episodes in I found out that this hits a spot as one of the recommended anime with absolutely stellar music. Even if you don't know about this, you'll still feel how amazing the soundtracks are.

### 5/10 | Characters

The characters are pretty weak, especially Haruka as he's the lead here. He's boring but still enjoyable in a way. Although, the development for each girls are noticeable and pretty nice. Each one carries a unique personality that depicts their personality. You might see they're boring at first, but with each one getting their own story, you can tell how they're developing as a character.

## Verdict

Quite an underrated show. I believe as a subject in literature or film-making, the term taboo should have a broader meaning other than something to disgust, forbid, or completely avoid. But, for anyone looking for a good romance drama, this is unfortunately not one you're looking for, quite far from being the ideal recommendation.

This is not a show with the usual fluff and fun harem, it's a serious drama with consequences for everyone depending on the girl chosen. I think a lot of viewers (including me) who didn't know better were expecting the usual comedy, but that's clearly not what the writers are aiming for. It wasn't easy to watch to the bitter end, but it's a lot better than I expected. So, here's the verdict from me...

1. Watch this if you're willing to keep an open mind.
2. DO NOT, watch this if you can't handle sad/depressing things.
3. Only watch episode 1 to 9 and stop there. You'll still get most of the story and experience from that and you won't need to see taboo and sad part with it, but it'll completely feel like a typical and generic romance/drama show.

**The final arc (10-12) didn't treat incest as something simple or for fun and excitement, they gave all the serious weight it was due. *Society* will see it as wrongdoing, and there will be little to no understanding for those transgressing on taboos. It was certainly not a laughing matter, but it did a really good job of making us empathize and feel the pain they were feeling. It was also thought provoking, at least for me.**

If you're still uncertain, perhaps give the first 2 episodes a chance before deciding if it's worth your time. Do decide early before regretting your decision.

If you do choose option 3, you might understand why some people are bashing this show for being "generic" and "boring". But, if you choose to continue through the last 3 episodes, then you might be able to see something else with a deeper meaning and that's what really caught most people's attention.

<!-- SPOILERS -->

As you've already decided to open this section, I'm sure you know what's coming. We'll be discussing more on Sora's arc as it felt like the true ending to the show. But, before that...

## Hateful comments

**Most** bad reviews are just hating incest in this without actually writing about the show itself, it's total nonsense. I don't really make sense to just drop a show just because a kiss between siblings (or twins) is it, it's not really justifiable by itself. I see a supportive relationship between orphaned siblings who just lost their parents with no one else to go, trying to support each other, but I guess that's not what most people saw, unfortunately. Well, it's not really my job either to make you love or hate this show. I'm just here to give my perspective, critique, and reviews objectively.

If you're still complaining only about the incest here, then you should've stop watching it after the first episode. I've given my verdict and provided a couple of options for you to choose before you approach this too. You're not really criticizing the show either, just hating it because it has incest in it. You won't really get anywhere by being a close-minded person who hates things just because, and you won't grow as a person either.

## Breakdown

We got to see what happens to each girls on 4 different stories. We also learned that just because someone's not saying anything doesn't mean it's going well on their side. We saw Haruka resolves Kazuha's problems on the first arc, but then we learned that Akira is having her own problems on the second arc. It's just like in real life, just because we don't see it doesn't mean it's not there.

### Sora's ending explanation

- Haruka gets a message from her, indicating she's either running away or committing suicide. He rushes out but doesn't seem to take his phone with him as we found out that he and Nao needed to meet rather than phone each other.
- Haruka then remembers Akira's words about the lake near Sayori-hime's shrine, believed to be the birthplace of humanity where one could get a chance to be reborn and redo your life. He immediately rushes there.
- After arriving at the shrine and before going to the lake, he stops by the gate in front of Akira's house. But, he doubted himself before having flashbacks where he was confronted by his friends.
- He also remembers when Akira was sad because she lost her mother's pendant (they manage to retrieve the pendant only on Akira's arc, so they're still distant here). He decided to settle this by himself and went for Sora alone.
- Akira felt something and went outside, but confused to find her gate open with no one in sight.
- Haruka runs towards Sora in the lake, just as he reaches out, Sora steps into deep water. Haruka rushes to save her, with neither of them being able to swim, they end up sinking each other in their struggles.
- As they sink deeper, Haruka thought to himself, thinking if they can go to a world far away, alone.
- Seconds later, we see Haruka wakes up as Sora cries. With the seemingly inverted landscape behind with dead trees sticking out of the lake behind them. There were no dead trees on the surface previously and it only appears halfway after they were sinking. They talked and tears were shed, it's strongly implied they remained there until dawn.
- Haruka asks if they were alive, and there were no response from Sora.
- Later on, Ryouhei, Akira, Kazuha, Kozue, and Nao met each other at the usual intersection on the way to school. Kazuha looks displeased to meet the others, it's soon evident that it is the first time all five of them got together since Haruka and Sora "went away".
- Akira asks if Kazuha has got any text from them since "that one". We're treated to a flashback of her reading a **message from Haruka** in class with the others. It's remarkably vague with the words "local buses", "local lines", "few times", and "reached our destination".
- All of them decided to stop by the Kasugano's house for some reason.
- As Kazuha passes by the patio doors **alone**, she gives a very understated bow, one that's similarly given towards a shrine, or a grave.
- As Akira passes by Sora's room, she looked through the broken window and saw **Sora's rabbit lying on the bed, shredded**.
- It then switches to the final scenes of Haruka and Sora almost exactly like the first time we saw them. Dressed in white on a train with Haruka's suitcase and **Sora's rabbit** in tact, passing through the darkness (a tunnel perhaps) and **not at their destination** yet.
- The train suddenly emerges into the light with nothing but sky and clouds through the windows, and with no one else visible on the train.

### Conclusion

Haruka and Sora are dead, their bodies will never be recovered as they drowned in the lake and no one knows they're there. Sora is a physically weak girl and she can't swim as we saw her use an inflatable swim ring a couple of times.

Kazuha broke into their house and found Haruka's phone with the final message from Sora, deducing they died in a lover's pact after missing for several days. So, to give everyone else a closure, she used Haruka's phone to send herself a fake message we saw her read previously.

The fact that the message didn't say anything about their uncle or aunt that has went back to Japan proved that it wasn't Haruka who wrote it since he only told Sora and no one else knew about it. We also saw that Kazuha is the only one that bowed towards the house because she knows they're dead.

The bunny at the final scene is just evidence for slow ones like myself to notice. That bunny is an irreplaceable final gift from their mother to Sora, so there's no way she more than one of it. The empty train emerging from the darkness points to both of them being "reborn" into an afterlife together.

> In solitude, where we are least alone

This is the show's tagline. Haruka and Sora did in fact went somewhere else, they died in that lake and were reborn to their own place in the magical afterlife, in solitude, where they're least alone and able to share their love without shame or disapproval from others.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to find something less depressing to think about...

Thankfully, I was watching [Eromanga-sensei](reviews/anime/eromanga-sensei) at the same time. Perhaps it could lighten up your mood just like it did for me.
