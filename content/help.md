Having trouble navigating through the page? Don't know what or where to look first? Read the brief explanation for each pages below, perhaps there's something for you in those pages.

## [About](about)

About page explains who I am, what I do, my hobbies, my socials and other trivial stuff.

## [Curated](curated)

Curated pages are stuff I find interesting or worthwhile to be compiled into a dedicated post that will be frequently updated.

## [Posts](posts)

Posts pages are just my daily blog posts that doesn't fit in the other dedicated pages. Just like any blog, I'll talk about various stuff in my posts that is separated by tags.

## [Reviews](reviews)

Reviews are pretty self-explanatory. I try to review all content I consume as objectively as possible. I treat each review as a way to show my appreciation for the content that has been made, even if I don't recommend it, I'll still try to see it from another perspective and take the positive out of it.

Most reviews will be accompanied by a `Spoilers Section`, which is just me theorizing and basically overanalyzing everything in the content I reviewed.

## [Uses](uses)

I really make sure to take my time before settling with something, I would literally spend hours or even days researching for the best of anything before truly settling on one. Because I'm lazy and I don't frequently change my things, I want the best for the job so that I don't have to worry much in the future and could stick to one thing and get comfortable with it.

Uses page will serve as a living document to see all of the things I've researched and bought before so I don't have to spent a lot of time to redo my research again and just refer back here. I also love to collect and track my stuffs so I can see how long something lasted before it was replaced, the cause of replacement, and just some nostalgic stuff.
