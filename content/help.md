### [About](about)

I think this is pretty self-explanatory, right? It includes explanation for who I am, what I do, hobbies, socials, some fun facts, and other trivial stuff.

### [Curated](curated)

Curated page consists of things I find interesting or worthwhile to be compiled into its own dedicated timeless post, so it shouldn't matter when it's being read. It also hosts the special [Monthly Curation Feed](curated/monthly), subscribe so you'll get the latest curation at the start of every month.

### [Posts](posts)

Posts page are just blog posts for various stuff happening or has happened. Would talk about life in general, have a tutorial post, or just discussing general technology or programming specific.

### [Reviews](reviews)

Reviews page is the place where I try to express myself the most. I try to review all content I consume as objectively as possible and treat each review as a way to show my appreciation for the content that has been made. Even if I don't recommend it, I'm sure there's always something to learn from and take the positive out of it.

Most reviews will be accompanied by a **Spoilers Section**, which is just me theorizing and basically overanalyzing everything in the content I reviewed.

### [Uses](uses)

Uses page are somewhat a trend for people who have their own blog or website. Although, I've added a personal touch to my uses page. It doubles down as a living document for all the things I've researched and bought. I could spend hours or days before truly settling on one thing because I'm lazy and I prefer sticking to one thing rather than frequently changing them.

Because of that, I want the best for the job so I won't have to worry about its longevity, stick with just that one thing and get comfortable with it. Even if it somehow broke after 5 years or more, I would still have a benchmark I could compare it to for future replacements.

It could also serve as my personal reviews with testimonies for your reference on deciding what to use. Also, it induces a bit of personal nostalgia knowing your old stuffs.
