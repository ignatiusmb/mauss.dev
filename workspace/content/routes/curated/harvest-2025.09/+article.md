### the Meta problem

**[Some Facebook users might have unknowingly let Meta access their photos.](https://www.zdnet.com/article/is-meta-secretly-scanning-your-phones-camera-roll-check-this-setting-to-find-out/)** \
how are they still in business, and why are people still using Facebook? that's a rhetorical question, of course; i'm aware the general public isn't as tech-savvy as Meta's own employees. the real question is when we'll stop tolerating this exploitative behavior.

**[Ex-WhatsApp cybersecurity executive says Meta endangered billions of users in new suit](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/08/meta-user-data-lawsuit-whatsapp)** \
i'm also aware that WhatsApp is the de facto messaging app in many countries, including mine. i've tried to switch before, but the network effect is too strong. with everyone else — including businesses — on WhatsApp, there's little incentive to move away from it. but this is getting ridiculous, i don't want to be on a platform that treats users' data as a commodity.

remember these?

the second cour from the final season of *Dr. Stone* just wrapped up, and it was [one of the best](/curated/anime-at-its-peak#dr-stone) i've seen in a while. i can't wait for the third and final cour — hopefully the wait won't be too long.

### end of summer 2025

September's theme is a bit all over the place. it's mostly about closing out the summer season and taking a breather before the fall season begins on October 4. here's what i watched this month:

**[How I Attended an All-Guy's Mixer](/reviews/anime/goukon-ni-ittara-onna-ga-inakatta-hanashi)** \
it's... okay. i enjoyed the dynamics between the characters, except for one who got too much screen time. the OP and ED are catchy though.

**[The Beginning After The End](/reviews/anime/saikyou-no-ousama-nidome-no-jinsei-wa-nani-wo-suru)** \
bruh. who came up with this, and why.

**[My Wife Has No Emotion](/reviews/anime/boku-no-tsuma-wa-kanjou-ga-nai)** \
the fastest i hit play on a show after reading the title. peak story.

**[My Stepmom's Daughter Is My Ex](/reviews/anime/mamahaha-no-tsurego-ga-motokana-datta)** \
good animation wasted on a mediocre romcom.

**[Dandadan](/reviews/anime/dandadan)** \
season 2 just wrapped up and it's *peak*.

**[Call of the Night](/reviews/anime/yofukashi-no-uta)** \
another season 2 that just ended, solid A-tier.

**[My Dress-Up Darling](/reviews/anime/sono-bisque-doll-wa-koi-wo-suru)** \
yet another season 2 that just wrapped up, also solid A-tier. the weekly cliffhangers were brutal.

**[Sakamoto Days](/reviews/anime/sakamoto-days)** \
solid B-tier, i enjoyed this second season as much as the first.

**[The Girl I Like Forgot Her Glasses](/reviews/anime/suki-na-ko-ga-motto-suki-nan-desu)** \
from an underappreciated studio comes a hidden gem. i don't think this anime — or the studio — gets enough recognition. i love the art style, it's gorgeous and unique. which reminds me...

**[The Masterful Cat Is Depressed Again Today](/reviews/anime/dekiru-neko-wa-kyou-mo-yuuutsu)** \
this might be my first recorded anime re-watch, which i was reminded of after seeing the credits in *The Girl I Like Forgot Her Glasses*. it's also my first S-tier slice of life, and honestly, the best adaptation the genre could get. i could watch this every year and never get tired of it.

**[Chainsaw Man - The Movie: Reze Arc](/reviews/movie/chainsaw-man-reze-hen)** \
i'm *so* glad more anime are getting the cinematic treatment. it was just *Demon Slayer* a few months ago, and now the long-awaited *Chainsaw Man* movie. i do wish it ran longer than 101 minutes, especially after waiting since 2022.

### ongoing

**[City The Animation](/reviews/anime/city-the-animation)** \
i was about to watch the final episode yesterday but *Chainsaw Man* came first. this is easy S-tier though.

**[Gachiakuta](/reviews/anime/gachiakuta)** \
12/24 episodes, it's been peak so far.

**[Kaiju No. 8](/reviews/anime/kaijuu-8-gou)** \
second season. continuing strong, though not much new to say.

**[Pseudo Harem](/reviews/anime/giji-harem)** \
the OP is such a banger for the genre.

**[Tougen Anki](/reviews/anime/tougen-anki)** \
blood guns(?)

## pieces

![the art of less card image](/posts/art-of-less/card.png "[The Art of Less](/posts/art-of-less)")

live with less, live in brevity. less is an act of discipline, a deliberate refusal of excess. it is not absence, because what remains is chosen with intent. it is not apathy, because it requires mindfulness. less is the foundation on which something greater can grow.

### simplicity

**[You're Not Interviewing for the Job. You're Auditioning for the Job Title](https://idiallo.com/blog/performing-for-the-job-title)** ([hn thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45109324)) \
the whole song and dance is cultural rot.

**[Do the simplest thing that could possibly work](https://www.seangoedecke.com/the-simplest-thing-that-could-possibly-work/)** \
do the simplest thing *possible*.

**[Cognitive load is what matters](https://github.com/zakirullin/cognitive-load)** \
hard to achieve, but doesn't mean we shouldn't try and strive for it.

**[The Virtue of Simplicity](/posts/simplicity)** \
the more complex something is, the more urgent it becomes to simplify.

### ADHD

**[Notes on Managing ADHD](https://borretti.me/article/notes-on-managing-adhd)** \
practical advice from someone who has lived it. this one hit close to home.

**[Almost anything you give sustained attention to will begin to loop on itself and bloom](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/attention)** \
you're already doing it — so why not do it well and give it your full attention? half-hearted attention means i'll only be wasting my time.

**[Becoming the person who does the thing](https://www.fredrivett.com/2025/09/10/becoming-the-person-who-does-the-thing/)** \
not ADHD-specific, but true: starting is the hardest part. once you start, momentum keeps you going.

### injustice

**[Being good isn't enough](https://joshs.bearblog.dev/being-good-isnt-enough/)** \
sweet talk is rewarded more than competence. the loudest voice "wins" easily.

**[The worst possible antitrust outcome](https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/03/unpunishing-process/)** \
i guess this is the power of billions of dollars, even justice and democracy can be bought.

### technical

**[Stop writing CLI validation. Parse it right the first time.](https://hackers.pub/@hongminhee/2025/stop-writing-cli-validation-parse-it-right-the-first-time)** \
a modern take on "parse, don't validate".

**[The story of how RSS beat Microsoft](https://buttondown.com/blog/rss-vs-ice)** \
RSS isn't dead, and never will be.

### fascinating

**[In Every Tree, a Trillion Tiny Lives](https://archive.ph/FqrQ9)** \
it's amazing how alive trees are, and how much we still don't know about them.

**[Immunotherapy drug eliminates aggressive cancers in clinical trial](https://www.rockefeller.edu/news/38120-immunotherapy-drug-eliminates-aggressive-cancers-in-clinical-trial/)** ([study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1535610825003198)) \
major progress in cancer treatment, with real clinical backing.

**[Repetitive negative thinking is associated with cognitive function decline in older adults](https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-025-06815-2)** \
who would've guessed that always assuming the worst and overthinking everything would be bad for your brain. `/s`

**[Why We Spiral](https://behavioralscientist.org/why-we-spiral/)** \
psychology should be taught more in schools. you can't live well if you don't understand your own mind.

**[You're a Slow Thinker. Now what?](https://chillphysicsenjoyer.substack.com/p/youre-a-slow-thinker-now-what)** \
writing is peaceful for slow thinkers.

## tracks

@youtube{id=oAuKa5NOzWE caption="[風と私の物語](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzX98z_pNs) by Ado"}

i'm convinced. Ado can definitely sing mellow songs and still hit the mark.

### Best Friend

@youtube{disclosure id=C-CYwNz3z8w caption="[Monitoring (Best Friend Remix) feat. Hatsune Miku](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=q12xLgfq2p8) by DECO*27"}

no way. i thought i was too late last month, but apparently the party's just getting started! lez f'in goo `(֊⎚-⎚)`

### peak Teto

@youtube{disclosure id=UHbmkxv-874 caption="[ライアーダンサー／重音テトSV](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=jblCQkH1lA4) by マサラダ"}

idk why i didn't include *Liar Dancer* last month. it deserves way more views than it has.

@youtube{disclosure id="sqK-jh4TDXo?start=32" caption="[Machine Love (feat. Kasane Teto)](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=NKSqoIGYzGY) by Jamie Paige / JamieP"}
@youtube{disclosure id=0iVlSNpq8i8 caption="[BIRDBRAIN (w/ OK Glass) feat. Kasane Teto](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=dBLzh47wdrU) by Jamie Paige / JamieP"}

in *Machine Love*, Teto is a computer longing to be real. in *BIRDBRAIN*, she learns how hard it is to be a human being. both MVs are a masterclass on their own.

> the 'P' in 'JamieP' stands for "peak".

last month i learned how DECO\*27 is basically a brand name for their Miku songs. this time, JamieP feels to English Teto what DECO\*27 is to Miku. the JamieP + Teto combo is just peak like that.

### English vocal synths

@youtube{disclosure id=oKyqHbk_WlU caption="[Self Proclaimed Angel ft. Tsurumaki Maki](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=qYF5vcVge98) by VocaloKAT"}

quite possibly a turning point for English vocal synths.

@youtube{disclosure id=vjBFftpQxxM caption="[BUTCHER VANITY ft. Yi Xi](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=o4dxH06Jgp0) by FLAVOR FOLEY"}
@youtube{disclosure id=KlTNKOnfXFk caption="[Static ft. Hatsune Miku](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=Qc8nkGIRft8) by FLAVOR FOLEY"}
@youtube{disclosure id=LvYL8u4p-aM caption="[Spoken For ft. Kasane Teto](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=E3RiJGexoMo) by FLAVOR FOLEY"}

these are the three best tracks i've heard so far from FLAVOR FOLEY. i also love how they weave other languages seamlessly into their English lyrics. a couple more below with vocal synths other than Miku and Teto:

@youtube{disclosure id=M7VSEZOQIlg caption="[weathergirl ft. Eleanor Forte](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=C4gZWTeU6QQ) by FLAVOR FOLEY"}
@youtube{disclosure id=-eDYT_20YhM caption="[炜WARD ROMANCE ft. Feng Yi](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=GpBf5ZOUR_A) by FLAVOR FOLEY"}

### not on my bingo card

@youtube{disclosure id=sV2H712ldOI caption="[Confessions of a Rotten Girl / ft. Hatsune Miku](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=_JeLNAjjBHw) by SAWTOWNE"}

never thought i'd see the day Beethoven's tunes get remixed with Miku. the references are crazy, and the tuning is spot-on. SAWTOWNE is also a brand name for their English Miku tracks. here's one that made it to a live concert:

@youtube{disclosure id=LaEgpNBt-bQ caption="[M@GICAL☆CURE! LOVE ♥ SHOT! feat. Hatsune Miku](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=17JZKJlx5uI) by SAWTOWNE"}

Miku is right, this *was* indeed the moment i've been waiting for. here's the [live version at MIKU EXPO 2024 North America](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6VhAvtekeU).

### underappreciated

@youtube{disclosure id=tQM8pfwmcU0 caption="[‘mochimochi’ feat. 初音ミク](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=-9zS6f9E-L8) by TAK / DORIDORI"}

from the character designs to the production, everything about TAK / DORIDORI's songs is cute and catchy. i absolutely love their latest one, *PPPP*.

Rosu's voice is unreal, i was surprised to find out that it's *not* a vocal synth.

## clips

@youtube{id=zV9v0RIE-iI caption="The Dirty Supply Chain Behind Indonesia's Poisoned Tofu"}

ain't no way... i watched Andrew's video on [Indonesia's TOXIC TOFU Timebomb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPyRAcdZHDo) a while back, but it never hit me that *nearly all* tofu in Indonesia comes from these facilities. which means i've probably been eating toxic tofu all along. yikes.

bruh. this video is mindboggling for all the wrong reasons:

- illegal trash exports dumped on developing countries
- "recycled" plastics burned as fuel, producing 10× the WHO safe particle limit
- microplastics carrying bacteria, pathogens, viruses, and pollutants
- contamination spreading through the air, water, soil, and food chain
- leading to serious health issues, from cancer to infertility

Indonesians eat tofu more than beef or chicken, it's been a staple for generations. and that's exactly why many people here dismiss the risks, with the mindset:

> "i eat tofu almost every day since i was a kid, and i'm perfectly fine." \
> "my parents ate tofu their whole lives, and they're perfectly fine."

Indonesians are so *cooked* 🗿

## reflections

why do i always end up cramming everything at the last minute? clearly, i *don't* learn from these things. also, it was hard, ngl. but i did manage to ignore the constant barrage of AI news this time around.
