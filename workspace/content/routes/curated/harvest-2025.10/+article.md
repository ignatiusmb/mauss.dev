## headlines

### AI slop is insulting

**[It's insulting to read your AI-generated blog post](https://blog.pabloecortez.com/its-insulting-to-read-your-ai-generated-blog-post/)** \
please. [writing is thinking](/posts/art-of-less#structured-thought). if you can't be bothered to think for yourself, then don't write. unfortunately, reading literacy is declining rapidly these days, and i'd argue that's the easier part of the equation. on the other hand, it's [A Terrible Time to Be a Writer](/posts/a-terrible-time-to-be-a-writer) for many of us.

responses from LLMs are not facts, **[stopcitingai.com](https://stopcitingai.com/)**.

### a dystopian present

**[Discord customer service data breach leaks user info and scanned photo IDs](https://www.theverge.com/news/792032/discord-customer-service-data-breach-hack)** \
**[Discord says 70,000 users may have had their government IDs leaked in breach](https://www.theverge.com/news/797051/discord-government-ids-leaked-data-breach)** \
oh no... who would've thought giving our sensitive info out online could lead to data breaches? shocking. at this point, they should change the button from "submit" to "publish" on these forms. i can't remember the last time i trusted a platform with my personal info that didn't end up leaking it. this was inevitable the moment platforms started taking IDs as verification.

**[Meta will listen into AI conversations to personalize ads](https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/01/meta_ai_use_informs_ads/)** \
i know that *none* of us are surprised, but shouldn't we *be*? it's sad that this is how the current state of the internet is.

**[OpenAI says over a million people talk to ChatGPT about suicide weekly](https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/27/openai-says-over-a-million-people-talk-to-chatgpt-about-suicide-weekly/)** \
in light of how [ChatGPT convinced a suicidal teen to not look for help](/curated/harvest-2025.08#headlines-ai-is-not-human-period).

**[Poison, Poison Everywhere](https://loeber.substack.com/p/29-poison-poison-everywhere)** \
quite literally. the air is so polluted in many cities that it's affecting people's health. even rainwater is filled with microplastics now. the dystopian future is already here.

**[What if I don't want videos of my hobby time available to the entire world?](https://neilzone.co.uk/2025/09/what-if-i-dont-want-videos-of-my-hobby-time-available-to-the-entire-world/)** \
i don't want my personal life to be public, and i especially don't want the things i do in my alone time to be publicly viewed. it's creepy. i'll be [quoting from a user in the comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45412419#45416089):
> I find photos and videos to both be invasive and unwanted.
>
> I've been a member and gyms where the owner will start taking videos and pictures of the class that ultimately end up on social media or in marketing material. I'm not ok with it and I get incredible uncomfortable when I'm in some weird position to do an exercise and a camera starts heading my way. \
> Any time an unwanted camera is around there is some level of anxiety that starts creeping up. Maybe this is, in part, why so many of today's youth have anxiety disorders. How can anyone just relax if they have to worry about anything they might say or do being on camera, and then posted for the world to see. \
> I was at a party not too long ago where most people were 45+, and some kids that were too young to have phones. No one was on their phones, and people seemed free to dance and whatever. The second one person took out their phone to take a picture/video the vibe shifted drastically, and the owner of the house told them to put it away, so people could go back to enjoying themselves instead of being worried about an embarrassing picture of video that might surface later.
>
> I've seen so many good times destroyed by cameras.

### don't believe in AGI

**[Andrej Karpathy — AGI is still a decade away](https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/andrej-karpathy)** \
**[This Is How the AI Bubble Will Pop](https://www.derekthompson.org/p/this-is-how-the-ai-bubble-will-pop)** \
**[The real deadline isn’t when AI outsmarts us — it’s when we stop using our own minds.](https://www.theargumentmag.com/p/you-have-18-months)** \
i'm already seeing signs of this happening. people are becoming overly reliant on AI for even the simplest tasks, leading to a decline in critical thinking and problem-solving skills. i also brought this up in the **minimal means** part of [A Discipline of Subtraction](/posts/art-of-less).

@youtube{disclosure id=GpC4YSMFekA caption="This is Much More Dangerous Than You Think."}

**[AI is Making Us Work More](https://tawandamunongo.dev/posts/2025/10/ai-work-more)** \
**[You are the scariest monster in the woods](https://jamie.ideasasylum.com/2025/10/15/you-are-the-scariest-monster-in-the-woods)**
> Just like a hammer, sword, or a rifle lying on a ground is nothing to be feared, so too is AI. It’s just an inanimate object; a tool, potentially. Now, if you equip humans with a hammer, or sword, or rifle, or AI then you’ve just made the scariest monster in the woods (that’s you) even more terrifying.

the heading is just a tongue-in-cheek reference to Pinocchio's ["Don't Believe in T"](https://youtu.be/Jtm6ikBIl0g) song, don't look too deep into it.

### keep Android open

**[What We Talk About When We Talk About Sideloading](https://f-droid.org/2025/10/28/sideloading.html)** \
this builds upon [Google requiring developer verification to install apps](/curated/harvest-2025.08#headlines-android-is-dead). we have the right to install whatever we want on our own devices. period.

**[Keep Android Open](https://keepandroidopen.org/)**. also, **[GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/)**.

## stories

![city the animation backdrop](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/1rxLKPOIHdJ9aFUwmzQ9gagZkUc.jpg "[City The Animation](/reviews/anime/city-the-animation) via [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/272118)")

absolute cinema. they really did "go out with a bang".

### slow month

**[Kaiju No. 8](/reviews/anime/kaijuu-8-gou)** \
it's OK... not really memorable, but not bad either.

**[The Summer Hikaru Died](/reviews/anime/hikaru-ga-shinda-natsu)** \
can't wait for the next season, the story grows on me.

**[The Fragrant Flower Blooms with Dignity](/reviews/anime/kaoru-hana-wa-rin-to-saku)** \
aah... i can't with the ending. a no BS lovebird story adapted with justice.

### ongoing

**[Gachiakuta](/reviews/anime/gachiakuta)** \
still going strong, loving every minute of it.

**[Tougen Anki](/reviews/anime/tougen-anki)** \
still enjoying the weirdness of it all.

**[Ranma ½](/reviews/anime/ranma-½-2024)** \
the second season! i miss the characters' dynamics.

**[One Punch Man](/reviews/anime/one-punch-man)** \
the third season. also known as "one frame man" these days.

**[My Hero Academia](/reviews/anime/boku-no-hero-academia)** \
the final season! it's absolutely going to be amazing.

huh, i thought i stepped into a lot more worlds than these... seems like a slow month for me.

## pieces

![card image for the chapter five of the orbit series](/posts/losing-the-questions/card.png "[Losing the Questions](/posts/losing-the-questions)")

finally formalized my yearly reflections into a series, this year is the fifth chapter. in addition, there's also another one called Solus, which is a more personal series on myself as a person and my life through solitude. start with the first chapter, titled [An Outsider Inside Myself](/posts/fractured-memories).

### fully present

**[Opting Out of the Algorithm](/posts/opting-out)** \
this is the second chapter in my Solus series. i think many people can relate to the feeling, but never really put it into words or reflect upon it. i hope more people can be aware of it, and actually take the first step to being present and mindful every day.

**[Slow social media](https://herman.bearblog.dev/slow-social-media/)** \
a lighter take on the same topic about social media. i like the idea of a platform limiting the number of posts or comments per day, as its users would be a lot more thoughtful about what they want to share.

**[Smartphones and being present](https://herman.bearblog.dev/being-present/)** \
unfortunately, it's getting harder to *not* be on our phones these days. especially with everything from seeing the menu to paying the bill being digital now. not to mention, infinite scroll and short form videos are essentially a slot machine for our brains.

**[Smartphones manipulate our emotions and trigger our reflexes](https://theconversation.com/smartphones-manipulate-our-emotions-and-trigger-our-reflexes-no-wonder-were-addicted-265014)** \
it's not really the smartphones themselves, but the apps and algorithms that are designed and programmed by humans. we have the equivalent of slot machines in everyone's pocket 24/7 with essentially no way to turn it off.

to close this part, let me just drop **[meow.camera](https://meow.camera/)** here.

### design and taste

**[Boring is good](https://jenson.org/boring/)** \
boring that *gets out of the way* is good, not the boring that is repetitive and tedious. too many products fall into the latter category. too many interfaces are cluttered and distracting.

**[You Had No Taste Before AI](https://matthewsanabria.dev/posts/you-had-no-taste-before-ai/)** \
taste is subjective, and it changes over time. so then, [What is "good taste" in software engineering?](https://www.seangoedecke.com/taste/) in a sense, principles are subjective too, and leaning on them dogmatically (without thought) is a sort of laziness. additionally, [tinkering is a great way to develop good taste](https://seated.ro/blog/tinkering-a-lost-art).

**[Xcode is the Worst Piece of Professional Software I Have Ever Used](https://holdtherobot.com/blog/xcode-is-the-worst-professional-software-i-have-ever-used/)** \
i have a feeling the only reason developers are still using Apple is because they have no choice other than the smartphone duopoly. otherwise, it might just be a case of Stockholm Syndrome.

**[What Happened to Apple's Legendary Attention to Detail?](https://blog.johnozbay.com/what-happened-to-apples-attention-to-detail.html)** \
i tried nearly all Apple devices once, and i never got the feeling of "this is it". it's always been mediocre at best, and i don't see how Apple has maintained its cult-like following for so long. [they even screwed up the keyboard input...](https://youtu.be/hksVvXONrIo)

### research

**[Depression Levels Are Associated with Reduced Capacity to Learn to Actively Avoid Aversive Events in Young Adults](https://www.eneuro.org/content/12/9/ENEURO.0034-25.2025)** \
depression is more like a sense of apathy and emptiness with no apparent cause or end in sight, it makes sense that people with depression wouldn't be able to learn to avoid aversive events.

**[The health benefits of sunlight may outweigh the risk of skin cancer](https://archive.fo/ypb35)** \
no way... i just wrote about my [Core Supplements](/posts/core-supplements) and opted to avoid sunlight altogether, opting for vitamin `D` supplements instead. i had a feeling avoiding sunlight altogether wasn't the best idea, i just didn't know what the trade-offs were.

**[Imaging Ultraweak Photon Emission from Living and Dead Mice and from Plants under Stress Click](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpclett.4c03546)** ([paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.11.08.622743v1)) \
wow, this is wild. we might be able to realize the "scanning for life forms" quite literally in the future.

**[Huntington's disease successfully treated for first time](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cevz13xkxpro)** \
incredible win. it's still early days, but a nice story to see these days.

**[Loneliness increases death risk by 32%](https://lightcapai.medium.com/the-loneliness-epidemic-threatens-physical-health-like-smoking-e063220dde8b)** \
i haven't dug through all the sources yet, but i have a feeling this might be correlational rather than causal or even reverse causation. someone with health issues might be more likely to have higher isolation and therefore be more lonely. keep in mind loneliness is not the same as being alone.

**[Faulty mitochondria cause deadly diseases: fixing them is about to get a lot easier](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03307-x)** \
amazing to see how far gene editing (and CRISPR-like tools) has come. hopefully this will lead to more breakthroughs in treating genetic diseases.

**[How electricity can heal wounds three times as fast](https://www.chalmers.se/en/current/news/mc2-how-electricity-can-heal-wounds-three-times-as-fast/)** \
i didn't know this was a thing, and i didn't know about [microcurrent electrical neuromuscular stimulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcurrent_electrical_neuromuscular_stimulator) devices until now.

**[The Brain Navigates New Spaces by ‘Flickering’ Between Reality and Old Mental Maps](https://medicine.yale.edu/news-article/brain-navigates-new-spaces-by-flickering-between-reality-and-old-mental-maps/)** \
this seems to support deja vu and the idea that dreams are rehearsals for real life.

**[How the Brain’s Activity, Energy Use, and Blood Flow Change as People Fall Asleep](https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/research-shows-coordinated-shift-in-brain-activity-while-asleep)** \
sleep is an important part of our lives, and one thing that's clear to me is that there is no such thing as sleep debt and "catching up on sleep". you need to get enough sleep every day, consistently. [sleep deprivation can cause serious permanent brain damage](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/STR.0000000000000453).

### technical

**[If you are good at code review, you will be good at using AI agents](https://www.seangoedecke.com/ai-agents-and-code-review/)** \
well... if you're good at code review, you will also be good at *not* using AI agents.

**[Greatest irony of the AI age: Humans being increasingly hired to clean AI slop](https://www.sify.com/ai-analytics/greatest-irony-of-the-ai-age-humans-being-increasingly-hired-to-clean-ai-slop/)** \
ironic, but not surprising. AI is just another tool.

**[Comprehension Debt: The Ticking Time Bomb of LLM-Generated Code](https://codemanship.wordpress.com/2025/09/30/comprehension-debt-the-ticking-time-bomb-of-llm-generated-code/)** \
not quite related to AI directly, but i touched on this topic in the **complexity inertia** part from [The Virtue of Simplicity](/posts/simplicity). relying fully on AI-generated code is a recipe for disaster in the long run.

**[A Story About Bypassing Air Canada's In-flight Network Restrictions](https://ramsayleung.github.io/en/post/2025/a_story_about_bypassing_air_canadas_in-flight_network_restrictions/)** \
interesting exploratory technical write-up, i like these kinds of articles.

**[How I Reversed Amazon's Kindle Web Obfuscation Because Their App Sucked](https://blog.pixelmelt.dev/kindle-web-drm/)** \
another interesting technical write-up! this is such a good way to learn as well.

**[The Programmer Identity Crisis](https://hojberg.xyz/the-programmer-identity-crisis/)** \
the most salient point from this article is seeing coworkers having to review an author taking no responsibility for their code and just blaming the AI for it, which should've been a people problem in the first place.

**[Code like a surgeon](https://www.geoffreylitt.com/2025/10/24/code-like-a-surgeon)** \
a piece that builds upon [The Mythical Man-Month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month), a book on software engineering from 1975 that feels more important now than ever.

**[AI can code, but it can't build software](https://bytesauna.com/post/coding-vs-software-engineering)** \
writing code isn't the same as delivering [working] software. there's a lot more to it than just writing code.

**[Why the open social web matters now](https://werd.io/why-the-open-social-web-matters-now/)** \
putting this here in the technical part first so that at least the technical audience will be aware and try to help smooth it out first. the main problem with these things are adoption, and getting the average user to switch would be hard if it isn't convenient enough.

### food for thought

**[Beyond the Front Page: A Personal Guide to Hacker News](https://hsu.cy/2025/09/how-to-read-hn/)** \
i think this is a good introductory guide for people new to Hacker News. HN does look a bit bare bones and intimidating at first, but it's quite a gem once you get the hang of it.

**[Always invite Anna](https://sharif.io/anna-alexei)** \
it's hard to find more people like Alexei as i grow older. i can relate to Anna a bit more, so i'm making it explicit to my close friends about my situation, not just any acquaintance.

**[Friendship Begins at Home](https://3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2025/10/friendship-begins-at-home.html)** \
introspection and self-awareness are the prerequisites to loving yourself.

**[Work is Not School: Surviving Institutional Stupidity](https://www.leadingsapiens.com/surviving-institutional-stupidity/)** \
i kinda have to learn this the hard way, but at least i'm aware of it now.

**[NIRS fire destroys government's cloud storage system, no backups available](https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/2025-10-01/national/socialAffairs/NIRS-fire-destroys-governments-cloud-storage-system-no-backups-available/2412936)** | **[G-Drive Fire Destroys 125,000 Officials' Data](https://www.chosun.com/english/national-en/2025/10/02/FPWGFSXMLNCFPIEGWKZF3BOQ3M/)** \
and that... is why you always have *backups*, preferably offline and far away from the main site.

**[Orcas are bringing humans gifts](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2486216-orcas-are-bringing-humans-gifts-what-does-it-mean/)** \
i find this oddly terrifying, somehow.

**[Human washing machine pods coming to Japanese hotels](https://soranews24.com/2025/10/09/human-washing-machine-pods-coming-to-japanese-hotels%E3%80%90photos%E3%80%91/)** \
Japan never ceases to amaze me. i wonder how comfortable and effective it is though.

**[America Is Sliding Toward Illiteracy](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/10/education-decline-low-expectations/684526/)** \
i don't think it's just America, and mainly due to the rise of short-form content and declining attention spans. people just don't read as much as they used to, even the elderly...

**[Meet the real screen addicts: the elderly](https://www.economist.com/international/2025/10/23/meet-the-real-screen-addicts-the-elderly)** ([archive](https://archive.is/Xe0yW)) \
screen addiction is quite possibly the biggest pandemic humanity has ever seen. it's everywhere, and it's only getting worse.

**[The explosion of choice](https://aeon.co/essays/why-an-abundance-of-choice-is-not-the-same-as-freedom)** \
or *the illusion of freedom* as i would like to call it.

**[Samsung makes ads on $3,499 smart fridges official with upcoming software update](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/samsung-makes-ads-on-3499-smart-fridges-official-with-upcoming-software-update/)** \
this guarantees i will never buy a Samsung appliance. i learned my lesson with their TVs and fridges already.

**[Nearly 90% of Windows Games now run on Linux](https://www.tomshardware.com/software/linux/nearly-90-percent-of-windows-games-now-run-on-linux-latest-data-shows-as-windows-10-dies-gaming-on-linux-is-more-viable-than-ever)** \
wow, honestly this might be the tipping point for me to switch to Linux full-time. i can't think of anything else that holds me back on Windows more than the possibility of gaming and just laziness to start from scratch again.

## tracks

@youtube{id=Xx1TnVObQ0k caption="[Love Attribute feat. Hatsune Miku](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzX98z_pNs) by PinocchioP"}

i may not be fluent in Japanese (yet), but this song speaks to me on so many levels. a song about the faults and tribulations of love, not as a perfect and infallible thing it's most often portrayed as.

also, there seems to be a lot of wordplay in the lyrics that i won't fully understand, at least without the help of a native speaker for now. like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xx1TnVObQ0k&lc=UgyxJmC0aRKqPW-gL8R4AaABAg) for example:

> 「弱い（yowai）」には愛（ai）が入ってるけど、「強い（tuyoi）」には愛（ai）が入ってない。「救えない（sukuenai）」には愛（ai）が入ってるけど、「救う（sukuu）」には愛（ai）が入ってない。愛するのは、こんなに悲しいことなのか…

or that [they deliberately used a certain kanji](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xx1TnVObQ0k&lc=UgwMuyUGv-6wUNdOA6t4AaABAg) in the MV

> あえて「ヰ」と表現しているあたり、 \
> ぽっかり空いた心の穴を埋めて欲しい \
> みたいな表現に聞こえる。

### another *dimention*

@youtube{disclosure id=uDnKy_FYgvA caption="[第n次元 (feat. Kasane Teto)](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=VIq5TaBXtxk) by 32ki"}

this may not be the highlighted track of the month, but it's one of my personal favorites that came out on the month! yes, i may have a slight bias towards Teto vocals, but the lyrics, too!

@youtube{disclosure id=6JEdJWwcIyk caption="[PLAY ft. Miku](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=hHeMolgpogw) by Giga"}

this came out before *Dimention No.n*, and i can't help but see the resemblance in both MVs. also, every "Giga ft. Miku" is just *something else*...

### they had no business going this hard

@youtube{disclosure id=SJcgOWsDwi4 caption="[Beyond the way ft.Miku・Rin・Len](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxr9bxikHcU) by Giga"}
@youtube{disclosure id=BqFyfOIdRYM caption="[Beyond the way](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=hHeMolgpogw) 【3DMV】 by Vivid BAD SQUAD × 初音ミク"}

both the MVs are so cool. there's also the [full version of the song from Vivid BAD SQUAD](https://youtu.be/UAzw5B-35kI).

@youtube{disclosure id=KF9Mu2gXNdI caption="[ULTRA C ft.Rin・Len](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=rG5xphbaSYk) by Giga & TeddyLoid"}
@youtube{disclosure id=DlNC-kvZcq4 caption="[ULTRA C](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=FdxinjBrQWI) 【3DMV】 by Vivid BAD SQUAD × 初音ミク"}

the Rin and Len duo from Giga feels so iconic, perhaps stemming from [*BRING IT ON* 7 years ago](https://youtu.be/oEkGC2HV7rc). yes, there's also the [full version from Vivid BAD SQUAD](https://youtu.be/7WryveKlyX8) as well.

@youtube{disclosure id=Dq2HJl5vKbY caption="[I GOT YOU! ft.Miku・Rin・Len](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=7RYNB5onLKU) by Giga"}

this song is fire. i *think* it might be a sponsored song from Pokemon, but damn is it not the catchiest song about Pokemon i've ever heard.

### PinocchioPeak

@youtube{disclosure id=lMEt3RdqB9Y caption="[(Not) A Devil feat. Hatsune Miku](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=AFSlEd6Sp9o) by DECO*27 x PinocchioP"}

when two GOATed producers collab, you're bound to get a banger.

### music videos

i didn't include these in the [tracks](#tracks) part, mainly because these are more for the visuals than the music itself. meaning, i watched instead of listened to them for the month.

## reflections

this harvest is heavy on pieces and clips. it was a slow month for stories and tracks, as i spent most of my time reading and writing instead. i'm trying to be more present and mindful these days, and it feels good to slow down and reflect on things more deeply.
