Confidence isn't "I believe I won't fail", but rather "Even if I do fail, I will be fine"

Most perfectionist are procrastinators because anxiety makes it difficult to start a project unless you're sure you can do it perfectly.

You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.

If you don't know how to make things better, just listen.

You're the only person you have to live with for the rest of your life. Take responsibility for what you do, learn how to move past your mistakes, and realize that your every action have consequences.

You don't have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great.
