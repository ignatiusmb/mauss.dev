title: the sequel that shouldn't be
---

## flashback inception

boruto opens with a dramatic scene of destruction — the village in ruins after an apparent major battle. great hook, but then it jumps backwards years into the past and forgets it even teased us with something exciting. every episode after feels like a stalled prequel, with little to no plot momentum. even if they do eventually deliver on that opening scene, can they really tie it back well after hundreds of episodes of fluff?

the anime is being written alongside the manga, which means no solid foundation and zero confidence in long-term storytelling. flashbacks within flashbacks become the norm, and "plot" is more like improv.

## filler hell

over 80% of the episodes are fillers. episode 156 — "i can't stay in my slim form" — was the final nail. a chocho filler. of all the characters. no stakes, no relevance, just air time to keep the train moving.

"i'm fine with character-x filler, or perhaps character-y filler, anything else, anything but chocho fillers."

same.

## visual degradation

the animation quality steadily degrades. even after a two-month hiatus, the return episode looked like a rushed school project. don't let the official artwork fool you — the actual visuals feel like 360p gameplay with every setting turned off.

## characters with no pull

boruto is insufferable. his entire arc revolves around daddy issues: naruto doesn't spend time with the family because he's running the village, and somehow that's a problem? there's no meaningful internal conflict — just petty rebellion and arrogance. the rest of the cast doesn't fare much better.
