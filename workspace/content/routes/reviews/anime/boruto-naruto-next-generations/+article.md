another weekly anime trying to stay relevant by milking a legacy name — this time, naruto's. it follows his son: a whiny clone with one less whisker per cheek, longer hair, and a k-pop attitude. he wants to step out of his father's shadow but ends up as a tantrum in motion.

this anime suffers from everything wrong with long-form weekly releases: a plot built backwards from a vague flash-forward, filler episodes outnumbering canon, and animation quality that drops faster than interest in chocho.

the story goes nowhere, characters are shallow, and the visual quality can't even match its own key art. the only passable element is the music — decent ops/eds, but wasted on this mess.

if you're still watching out of loyalty to naruto, stop. read the manga, or just watch the highlight clips on youtube — you'll get the same experience with 1% of the time investment.
