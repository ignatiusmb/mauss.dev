**a disappointing offspring**. Boruto is everything wrong with the weekly anime model. a story stretched thin, characters without weight, and animation that collapses under its own schedule.

the structure is built backwards from a vague flash-forward. filler arcs multiply until they bury the canon. the pacing stalls, then lurches forward, only to stall again. the visual quality rarely matches its own key art, let alone the standards set by its predecessor.

the manga carries a reputation for being tighter, but the anime smothers it. if you want the story, read. if you only want the spectacle, watch the highlight clips. the rest is time lost.
