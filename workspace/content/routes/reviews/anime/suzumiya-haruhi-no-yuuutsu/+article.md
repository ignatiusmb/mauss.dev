## Synopsis

## Plot

<!-- TODO: explain ways to watch -->

TL;DR: Broadcast order is clearly superior than Chronological order. You can [determine it for yourself from this explanation](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1w8ggp/wanting_to_watch_the_melancholy_of_haruhi_suzumiya/cezq5xx).

Here's an elaboration on why I highly recommend to watch the broadcast order first (you can then watch it again in Chronological order for the second time). The pacing is much better and its narrative has a proper [three-act structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-act_structure). You get a better context for Haruhi's character development and other characters are introduced as they become important to the plot rather than in the order they appear. You will also get to experience the mystery part throughout watching the series and it will gradually make sense as you connect the story pieces together, you won't get this feeling at all and the story would reach climax just after about 4 to 5 episodes if you go with the Chronological order, and this is the biggest reason why you should not watch it in Chronological order for the first time as it will most likely ruin the first impression.
