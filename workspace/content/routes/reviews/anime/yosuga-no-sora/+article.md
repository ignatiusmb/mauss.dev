*yosuga no sora* is a bold experiment — structured unlike most anime. it tells multiple stories across separate arcs, each emotionally distinct, but all rooted in the same quiet and rural backdrop. it's not a typical romance or slice-of-life. this isn't a light or casual watch, and it doesn't pretend to be one.

this wasn't my first anime, but it was the first that made me want to write about what i'd watched. for a 2010 anime, the visuals holds up well. backgrounds are vivid, detailed, and thoughtfully composed. the soundtrack is stellar, though it leans a bit too hard on one track for both sad and happy moments.

it's *almost* hentai — but if that's what you're after, you'll find better elsewhere. this isn't your typical harem or romance anime, and it's not trying to be.

go in with the right mindset. it's not for everyone. but if you're willing to sit with complex relationships and uncomfortable emotions, *yosuga no sora* might surprise you in ways i never expected myself.

if you give this a shot, i'll see you on ***the other page***.
