**not your typical romance anime**. *Yosuga no Sora* is **not** hentai — seriously, there are plenty of decent ones out there if that's what you're after, but this is definitely not one of them.

this wasn't my first anime, but it was the first that made me reflect so much that i needed to write about it. yes, it's got the *ecchi* tag, though i would've preferred if it didn't have it at all. i think the story would've stood out more if there were less fanservice and sex scenes — or none at all.

if you're into fanservice or loli figures, by all means, enjoy. i'm not here to judge. but if you're here just to get off, grab an actual hentai instead, will you?

if you do give this a shot, i'll see you on ***the other page***.
