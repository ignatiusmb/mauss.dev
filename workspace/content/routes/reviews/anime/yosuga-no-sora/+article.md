**not your typical romance anime**. Yosuga no Sora was the first anime that made me reflect deeply enough that i wanted to write about it. the *ecchi* tag is there, and i would have preferred if it wasn't. the story could have stood out more with less fanservice, or without it altogether.

beneath that, though, is a narrative that lingers — one that deserves more attention than its reputation suggests. i wrote more in **the deep dive**.
