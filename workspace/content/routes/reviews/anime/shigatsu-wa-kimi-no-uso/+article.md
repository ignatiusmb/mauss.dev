**can't think of April without this**. Your Lie in April blends music, emotion, and character development into a story that feels whole. the slow pacing suits the story, the visuals land where they need to, the animation feels fluid, and the sound design lifts everything higher. it's a complete package â€” enough for me to place it firmly in A-tier.
