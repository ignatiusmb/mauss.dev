the pacing is gentle and deliberate. it gives you space to feel — not just for the characters, but through them. the style walks a delicate line between whimsical and heavy, and the balance rarely falters. there's some humor, but it doesn't distract from the core emotional weight.

visually, it's stunning in all the right places. performances feel alive, with music sequences carrying more emotion than words ever could. the sound direction is especially worth noting — classical pieces are framed not as decoration, but as story.

this one lingers.
