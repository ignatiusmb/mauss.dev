**a timeless masterpiece**, made by one of my favorite studios, Kyoto Animation.

*nichijou*'s humor was 20 years ahead of its time. it's a perfect example of comedy that transcends time and culture, a unique blend of everything that resonates with people all over the world.

it's really hard for me to find something that helps me relax and cool my mind every now and then, and *nichijou* is one of those rare gems i can turn my brain off to and just enjoy from start to finish. even if i'm not laughing out loud every time, or when an episode ends and i'm waiting for the next one to start, i can't remember a time i wasn't grinning or smiling through the whole thing.

please don't take that as a challenge â€” remember, what matters is that we have fun. if you don't enjoy it as much as i do, that's too bad, but also totally fine.
