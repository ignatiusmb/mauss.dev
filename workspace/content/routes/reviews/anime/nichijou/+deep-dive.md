title: masterclass in comedy

imagine having an unlimited budget, a team of absurdly talented people, and the will to do whatever the hell you want. that's Nichijou.

## the absurd in the ordinary

a show without plot shouldn't work this well, yet Nichijou executes it seamlessly. it takes the most mundane parts of everyday life and amplifies them to absurd levels. even the most trivial situations can lead to hilariously over-the-top outcomes.

## Kyoto Animation's touch

this is KyoAni at their peak, overanimating even the most mundane and trivial stuff. it's ridiculous, and it's exactly what makes Nichijou unforgettable. i doubt it would've been half as funny without that passion and dedication from the animators.

## the painfully relatable one

Yuuko, of course it's her. i laugh the hardest at her misfortunes, but every laugh stings a little because most of her fails are painfully relatable.

## layered references

the manga's sense of humor already runs deep, and the anime carries it over. from Japanese wordplay that doesn't translate, to odd cultural nods like Yuuko greeting her friends with "selamat pagi" or Mio's mom casually playing [*sepak takraw*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepak_takraw).

## trolling done right

Mai, Mio's sister, and others exist solely to throw everyone off balance. they don't need to be cruel to be funny â€” being unpredictable is enough. every time they appear, you know the scene will collapse into absurdity, with or without setup.

## the successor

Nichijou flopped commercially, so a continuation never happened. but somehow, right as i'm writing this, [KyoAni announced *City the Animation*](/curated/harvest-2025.06#headlines-the-goats-are-back), which is the closest thing we'll get to season two. it's by the same author, Keiichi Arawi, set to premiere on the 7th.
