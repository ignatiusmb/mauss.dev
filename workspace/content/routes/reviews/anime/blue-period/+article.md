remind me why i love anime so much â€” it's everything in and with Blue Period. being interested in art was the last thing i expected. yeah, yeah, what could an anime about art possibly bring to the table? that was my initial thought too, and i'm so glad Blue Period proved me wrong in the best way possible.

ironically, the animation isn't the best for an art anime, but damn, the story and characters more than make up for it. no complaints about the pacing either, it's wraps up nicely for a 12-episode series. i didn't expect to be moved by the direction of this anime so much, but by the end of it, i was left with a sense of fulfillment.

the only regret i have is not watching this sooner, even though it had been in my watchlist since before it even aired. thankfully, a friend nudged me to bump it to the top. maybe that's a sign to start chipping away at my watchlist, one at a time. who knows, maybe i'll find more hidden gems like this.

i usually save these thoughts for ***the other page***, but i can't help admiring all the art i've come across after watching Blue Period, especially when i thought about the process of creating it. consider this a small note to my future self, let's see if i ever get around to it.
