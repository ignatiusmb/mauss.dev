**this deserved better than the adaptation it got**. ironic, for a story about art, Blue Period's anime adaptation feels rushed and underwhelming.

and yet, the strength of source material cuts through anyway. i didn't expect to care about art, but Blue Period made me see it differently. it sat in my watchlist since before it aired. i only picked it up because a friend pushed me, and i'm glad they did.
