a slice-of-life about two sisters and their friends doing everyday things. no twists, no big stakes. and it's exactly what makes it so enjoyable, i'm a sucker for these kinds of shows. it's like a warm hug on a cold day, or that perfect cup of tea when you need to unwind.

the humor hits consistently, the timing is tight, and it flows in a way that makes each episode breeze by. it gave me the same kind of joy [nichijou](/reviews/anime/nichijou) did — that rare feeling of genuinely laughing out loud without expecting to.

the animation has that warmth and attention to detail you don't notice until a facial reaction lands harder because of it. and the food — damn, the food. episode one made me crave buttered toast like it was a gourmet meal.

soundtrack is solid, catchy and custom-fit to the mood. great voice acting across the board. the whole sound design brings the world to life — playful, sweet, a bit odd, like the characters themselves.

the big sister might weird you out at first. that's fair, but stick with it for a little bit. her awkwardness unfolds into something deeply relatable, and by the end, you'll probably love her as much as i did. the little sister is just as endearing, and the side cast rounds it out without dragging the mood down.

it's not for everyone — and that's fine. but if you've ever needed a break from the loud, over-the-top stuff and wanted something cozy, this might be the best surprise you didn't know you needed.
