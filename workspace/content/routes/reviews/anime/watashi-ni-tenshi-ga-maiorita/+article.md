**a wholesome slice of life about two sisters and their friends**. i'm a sucker for this kind of show, so i went in biased — but it really does feel like a warm blanket on a rainy day. the humor gives me genuine laughs without trying too hard.

the animation has that kind of warmth and attention to detail you don't notice if you don't look closely for it. food shots especially stand out — that french toast in episode one nearly had me craving it on the spot.

![!video#f#hb](./french-toast-breakfast.mp4 "when your little sister makes your breakfast")

the soundtracks are catchy, sung by the cast themselves. voice acting is solid across the board, and the sound design makes the world feel alive and close.

the big sister might throw you off at first, but her awkwardness makes sense the longer you stay with her, and i ended up liking her by the end. the little sister is just as endearing, and the side cast fits in without dragging things down.

Wataten was a good and cozy anime which gives me a break from loud, over-the-top shows.
