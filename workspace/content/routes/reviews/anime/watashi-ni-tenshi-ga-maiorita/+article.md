a slice-of-life about two sisters and their friends doing everyday things. i'm a sucker for these kinds of shows, so the verdict might be a bit biased. but for real though, it's like a warm hug or a cozy blanket on a cold rainy day. the humor is just right, gave me the same kind of joy [Nichijou](/reviews/anime/nichijou) did — that rare feeling of genuinely laughing out loud without expecting to.

the animation has that warmth and attention to detail you don't notice until you pay a closer attention to the details. i mean, just look at the food! this short preview of episode one almost made me drool and had me craving buttered toast.

![!video#f#hb](./french-toast-breakfast.mp4 "when your little sister makes your breakfast")

soundtracks are catchy and seems like it was voiced by the actors themselves, and the voice acting are also great across the board. add all of that with the amazing sound design, it brings the world to life in a way that makes you feel like you're right there with the characters.

the big sister might weird you out at first, coz i did. but stick with it for a little bit, you'll eventually understand where her awkwardness comes from, and you'll probably love her as much as i did by the end of it. the little sister is just as endearing, and the side cast rounds it out without dragging the mood down.

these kinds of show are never for everyone — and that's fine. but if you've ever needed a break from the loud, over-the-top stuff and wanted something cozy, this might be the best surprise you didn't know you needed.
