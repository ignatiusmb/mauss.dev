title: love isn't always graceful
---

## awkward beginnings

the show opens with Miyako (the big sister) acting like a total creep around Hana. tripping over her words, bribing her with sweets, hiding behind walls, all around weird. but that clumsiness isn't malicious at all. she's socially starved and never learned how to connect or interact properly, especially with someone outside her bubble (which is just her family). you quickly realize that she's just deeply awkward and overwhelmed by how badly she wants a friend.

the line "it's okay. as long as everyone's smiling…" marks that shift for  me. Miyako isn't trying to push anyone's boundaries, she's genuine and sincere with her actions.

## isolation and skill

we don't see what Miyako does during the day and could've seem like another NEET, but she's competent in many ways. she bakes, sews, cooks, handles housework, and cares for her sister. Miyako is simply isolated, and that gave her time to hone skills most people overlook. she doesn't flaunt either and uses them to express care, especially for her little sister Hinata who adores Miyako so much. that relationship is core to the show's tone, unconditional and chaotic real love.

## dynamic contrasts

Hinata is pure dopamine energy hitting your face every time she appears, we know this early on. her affection for Miyako is so strong it's borderline delusional — but that imbalance works because Miyako doesn't exploit it. well, exactly because of that Hinata loves her so much. meanwhile, Hana acts too composed for her age, but it plays into the power dynamic — she's the only one Miyako struggles to "win". it makes their interactions tense, but it also challenges Miyako to grow. Noa and the rest of the cast are fine, but they serve mostly as foils or comic relief.

## the heart of the story

beneath the slapstick and sugar is something honest — a portrait of someone learning to reach out. Miyako could've stayed locked up, happy with her hobbies, safe from rejection. instead, she chooses to try. that decision to change and risk her solitude, is what makes her the heart of the story. we see her character grow through her awkward attempts to connect, all of the effort to be better for those you care about, and i love every bit of it.
