title: love isn't always graceful
---

## awkward beginnings

the show opens with Miyako acting like a creep around Hana — tripping over her words, bribing her with sweets, hiding behind walls. weird, but not malicious. she's socially starved and never learned how to connect outside her family. what looks like scheming is really just someone overwhelmed by wanting a friend. Miyako isn't pushing boundaries, she's genuine and sincere with her actions.

> it's okay. as long as everyone's smiling...

## isolation and skill

we don't see her daily life and she could be mistaken for a NEET, but she's capable: baking, sewing, cooking, housework, caring for Hinata. isolation gave her time to hone skills most people overlook. she doesn't flaunt them either, using them mainly to show care for her little sister.

## dynamic contrasts

Hinata is pure dopamine energy, her love for Miyako is so intense it's almost delusional. but Miyako never exploits it, which only makes Hinata love her more. Hana, on the other hand, acts too composed for her age and becomes the one person Miyako can't "win". their interactions stay tense, forcing Miyako to grow. Noa and the rest mostly serve as foils or comic relief.

## the heart of the story

beneath the slapstick and sugar is something honest: a portrait of someone trying to reach out. Miyako could have stayed in her safe bubble, content with hobbies and solitude. instead, she chooses to risk rejection. those awkward attempts, the effort to be better for people she cares about — that's what makes her the heart of the story. i love every bit of it.
