title: love isn't always graceful
---

## awkward beginnings

the show opens with *miyako* (the big sister) acting like a total creep around *hana*. tripping over her words, bribing her with sweets, hiding behind walls, all around weird. but that clumsiness isn't malicious at all. she's socially starved and never learned how to connect or interact properly, especially with someone outside her bubble (which is just her family). you quickly realize that she's just deeply awkward and overwhelmed by how badly she wants a friend.

the line "it's okay. as long as everyone's smiling…" marks that shift for  me. *miyako* isn't trying to push anyone's boundaries, she's genuine and sincere with her actions.

## isolation and skill

we don't see what *miyako* does during the day and could've seem like another NEET, but she's competent in many ways. she bakes, sews, cooks, handles housework, and cares for her sister. *miyako* is simply isolated, and that gave her time to hone skills most people overlook. she doesn't flaunt either and uses them to express care, especially for her little sister *hinata* who adores *miayko* so much. that relationship is core to the show's tone, unconditional and chaotic real love.

## dynamic contrasts

*hinata* is pure dopamine energy hitting your face every time she appears, we know this early on. her affection for *miyako* is so strong it's borderline delusional — but that imbalance works because *miyako* doesn't exploit it. well, exactly because of that *hinata* loves her so much. meanwhile, *hana* acts too composed for her age, but it plays into the power dynamic — she's the only one *miyako* struggles to "win". it makes their interactions tense, but it also challenges *miyako* to grow. *noa* and the rest of the cast are fine, but they serve mostly as foils or comic relief.

## the heart of the story

beneath the slapstick and sugar is something honest — a portrait of someone learning to reach out. *miyako* could've stayed locked up, happy with her hobbies, safe from rejection. instead, she chooses to try. that decision to change and risk her solitude, is what makes her the heart of the story. we see her character grow through her awkward attempts to connect, all of the effort to be better for those you care about, and i love every bit of it.
