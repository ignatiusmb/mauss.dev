title: love isn't always graceful
---

## awkward beginnings

the show opens with *miyako* acting like a total creep — frozen by *hana's* cuteness, tripping over her words, bribing her with sweets, hiding behind walls. but that clumsiness isn't malicious. she's socially starved and never learned how to connect properly, especially not with someone outside her bubble. you quickly realize she's not a threat — she's just deeply awkward and overwhelmed by how badly she wants a friend. the contrast is intentional: creepy at first glance, wholesome as you stay.

the line "it's okay. as long as everyone's smiling…" marks that shift. *miyako* isn't trying to push anyone's boundaries. she backs off, reflects, and always checks if the others are happy. she's not perfect, but she's sincere.

## isolation and skill

we don't see what *miyako* does during the day, but her competence fills in the blanks. she bakes, sews, cooks, handles housework, and cares for her sister without complaint. *miyako* isn't lazy — she's isolated. that isolation gave her time to hone skills most people overlook. she doesn't flaunt either and uses them to express care, especially for *hinata*, who practically worships her. that relationship is core to the show's tone — unconditional, chaotic, but built on real love.

## dynamic contrasts

*hinata* is pure dopamine energy hitting your face every time she appears. her affection for *miyako* is so strong it's borderline delusional — but that imbalance works because *miyako* doesn't exploit it. she keeps her distance emotionally while still protecting and uplifting her sister. meanwhile, *hana* acts too composed for her age, but it plays into the power dynamic — she's the only one *miyako* struggles to "win". it makes their interactions tense, but it also challenges *miyako* to grow. *noa* and the rest of the cast are fine, but they serve mostly as foils or comic relief.

## the heart of the story

beneath the slapstick and sugar is something honest — a portrait of someone learning to reach out. *miyako* could've stayed locked up, happy with her hobbies, safe from rejection. instead, she chooses to try. that decision — to change, to risk — is what makes her the heart of the story.
