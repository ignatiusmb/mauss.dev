title: Get the Latest Windows Update Now
description: ways to install the latest Windows updates immediately.

ever read the news about another big Windows update rolling out, but months later your own pc still hasn't received it? Microsoft staggers updates, so not every machine gets them right away — even if your hardware is more than capable of handling it.

before forcing an update, **always create a backup** of your files or, ideally, a full system image. while the upgrade process is usually non-destructive, things can still go wrong.

## the intended way

before trying to manually update, check if your system is eligible. major updates often have specific hardware requirements. if your pc doesn't meet them, you won't be able to install the update.

1. open **settings** (`win` + `i`)
2. go to **update & security** → **Windows update**
3. click **check for updates**
4. if a new version is available, click **download & install**
5. once downloaded, click **restart now**

## fallback method

as a fallback, you can use the **media creation tool** or the **update assistant** to force the update. both methods are official tools from Microsoft and are safe to use.

1. go to the [Microsoft download page](https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/)
2. select your desired Windows version (10 or 11)
3. click **download tool now**
4. run the tool and follow the prompts
