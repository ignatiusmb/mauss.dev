> **note**: i'm not a medical professional. this is a personal log of my own research and experience, written for my future self. it is not medical advice. i am documenting what i've learned and what i do. please consult a qualified professional before making any changes to your own health routine.

## Vitamin `D3`

this is the foundation of my routine. i don't grasp it as a "vitamin" in the classic sense, but more like a hormone that influences nearly everything from how my body uses calcium to my immune response and even my mood.

although anecdotal, the personal proof is impossible to ignore. when i get lazy and forget to take my supplements for days or weeks, the change is palpable. i'm hit with waves of fatigue, i catch colds easily, and my joints and bones just feel weak. it's an unpleasant, full-body experience. i've also noticed a clear dip in my mood, feeling genuinely depressed during those lapses.

since i actively avoid the sun due to skin cancer risk, supplementation is a non-negotiable for me. in my view, the risk outweighs the benefit, which means i have to get my vitamin `D` elsewhere.

### toxicity

one of the first things i had to understand was the risk. "hypervitaminosis" (toxicity) is a concern with vitamin `D` because it's **fat-soluble**. unlike water-soluble vitamins (like `C`) where the body just flushes out the excess, my body can't easily get rid of `D`, so it can build up.

that said, my research has shown me a few things:

1. **it only comes from supplements**. as far as i can tell, you can't get toxic levels from sunlight since our body regulates its own production.
2. **it seems to be extremely rare**. Dr. Bruce Hollis, a pioneer in vitamin `D` research, has apparently never even seen a case. [it seems far more likely we're not getting *enough*](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/premium/article/vitamin-d-nutrient-supplement-health).
3. **it's not the vitamin itself**. the real danger is its downstream effect of **hypercalcemia**, or too much calcium in the blood. this is what can lead to kidney problems or vascular calcification.

from what i've read, this only happens at absurd, sustained doses (hundreds of thousands of IU daily for months), not the modest doses most people use. this context is what makes me comfortable with my own routine.

**my dose**: i take **10,000 IU of `D3`** daily. i look for `D3` (not `D2`) and supplements without fillers like maltodextrin.

## Vitamin `K2 (MK-7)`

this one seems critical to take *with* vitamin `D`. from what i've read, `K2` is what directs calcium into bones and teeth, [improving bone quality and strength](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7230802/), while also keeping it out of arteries and soft tissues.

this is my primary safeguard against the main risk of vitamin `D` (vascular calcification). i specifically look for the `MK-7` form (not `MK-4`), at a ratio of at least 100 mcg for every 10,000 IU of `D3`.

**my dose**: i take **200 mcg of vitamin `K2 (MK-7)`**, which comes included in my daily `D3` supplement. i also get it from food (high-quality grass-fed butter and beef, kimchi, eggs).

## Magnesium Glycinate

my understanding is that this is another essential partner for vitamin `D` and also helps prevent vascular calcification.

i chose the `glycinate` form specifically because i've read it's highly bioavailable. as a bonus, it seems to help me sleep better. i get some from food (leafy greens, chocolate, nuts, pumpkin seeds), but i supplement it to be sure.

**my dose**: i take **500 mg of magnesium `glycinate`** daily, usually after dinner.

## Zinc

i learned that the vitamin `D` receptor (vdr) depends on zinc to function.

i'm careful with this one. i *think* i accidentally double-dosed once and felt incredibly sick, vomiting my lunch. it might have been a nocebo effect, but i'm avoiding pure zinc supplements for now and try to get it from food. if i do look for one, i'll make sure it's a low-dose blend with other trace minerals.

## Vitamin A (Retinol)

this seems to work similarly to `K2`, helping keep calcium out of the arteries. i also read that the `A` and `D` receptors can bind together as a complex.

i don't supplement this directly and rely on food sources like egg yolks, liver, and cod liver oil.

***

again, this is just my personal log. my experiences are anecdotal, but they are based on research that i find compelling. if you're reading this and considering a change, talk to a professional beforehand.
