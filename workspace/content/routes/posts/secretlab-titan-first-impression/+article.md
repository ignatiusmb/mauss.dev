> well, kind of. the chair has held up remarkably well over the years, and it remains comfortable for long working sessions. however, it doesn't seem to be as ergonomic as i initially thought. i had to buy an additional seat cushion and changed my table to an adjustable standing desk to get the optimal posture. it's a solid investment, but i don't think i'll be upgrading to another *gaming* chair in the future. instead, i'll look for more specialized ergonomic office chairs.

my Secretlab TITAN arrived at `17:20` and took roughly an hour to assemble solo. the unboxing experience was high-quality, but the assembly process is not intuitive. the components are heavy, and the instructions confirmed this is intended as a two-person job.

my quick impression of it was everything that i expected it to be. the last four points are the most important ones to me.

- smells nice
- build feels solid
- easy adjustable lumbar support
- comfortable adjustable armrests ✔
- comfortable head pillow ✔
- levelled seat base that enables cross-legged sitting ✔
- wide backrest recline angle ✔

my extended thoughts after using it for a few hours:

1. adjustable armrests allows me to quickly switch positions between working mode and leisure mode. my previous chair's static rests were the primary source of daily back and shoulder pain, as i couldn't properly support my right arm while using the mouse.
2. the combination of the included head pillow and the wide backrest recline angle allows for short rests at the desk, rather than leaving the workspace entirely and losing focus.
3. i have a long-standing habit of sitting cross-legged. the TITAN's wide, levelled seat base accommodates this without issue.

all things considered, this was a significant, necessary upgrade. it is a stark improvement over my previous chair, and i hypothesize it will have a net positive impact on my long-term productivity and physical health.
