in the vastness of the universe, human life is fleeting — a speck of dust, a brief flicker in cosmic time. yet within that short span, we grow and change in ways that redefine who we are — *canon events*, as some would say.

## crisis

we like to frame our lives in stages. one of them is the so-called *quarter-life crisis* — a time marked by uncertainty, when the expectations we once carried begin to dissolve. clinical psychologist Alex Fowke describes it as:

> a period of insecurity, doubt, and disappointment surrounding your career, relationships, and financial situation.

it's no surprise that many feel lost during this time. the transition when the freedoms of youth give way to the responsibilities of adulthood can feel overwhelming. we start to see that the path ahead isn't as clear as we once imagined, and life doesn't always align with the plans we made for it. the script we were handed ends, and we're left staring at a blank page.

## pivot

the "crisis" isn't ours to blame; it is a failure of the script itself. the disappointment comes from realizing that "the plan" was never aligned with a meaningful *process*, only a predictable *outcome*. we were taught to chase outcomes — the next degree, the next promotion, getting married, buying a house — but not to love the process of becoming ourselves.

this is where the Renaissance begins. historically, it was an era of renewal, an intellectual and artistic rebirth. it was an active, rigorous, and obsessive return to the fundamentals. a shift *away* from dogmatic outcomes and *toward* a fascination with process. i've come to see this stage of my life as a pivot from living for *a career* to living for *the craft itself*.

this "rebirth" is not a feeling, but an action. i am digging into the fundamentals of subjects i thought i knew, not for a credential, but for mastery. rebuilding old projects, not to ship them, but to understand their mechanics. i'm no longer creating for validation, but for the joy of creation itself.

## process

the Renaissance masters weren't famous for "arriving"; they were defined by their *studios* — their obsessive, daily practice. they fell in love with the *act* of mixing pigments, sketching anatomies, and solving problems. their masterpieces were the byproduct of a relentless devotion to the craft itself, the one thing they could control.

i've felt this before, but this time it feels grounded. i'm no longer chasing some idealized version of success or happiness. instead of being fixated on where i should be, i'm learning to appreciate where i am. the journey itself feels enough. there's joy in the mundane *practice*, peace in the quiet *focus*, and beauty in simply *doing the work*.

today marks my twenty-fifth orbit around the sun. there's comfort in knowing i don't need to have it all figured out. i just need to show up to "the studio" consistently, and do the work. in a way, it makes me grateful for the 'crisis'. it was the catalyst that forced me to reevaluate my values and priorities, to enjoy the *process of the craft*, and to find peace in *the work itself* — in letting the daily practice hold as much weight as the masterpieces i'm building.
