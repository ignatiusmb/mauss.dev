I don't know how you do it, it's not even 30 minutes into the concert and I almost lost my voice from singing along. The concert was amazing and I know it's going to be really good, but I didn't expect it to be as exhilarating as it was. I don't think anything has ever been able to give me goosebumps for as long and as strong as your voice that night, it was truly one of the best frisson I had in years!

As the title suggests, this will be a simple letter to express my admiration for you. I'm glad you get to travel and see the world for the first time through this concert tour. It felt surreal to be able to see you live and perform in person. Hearing you greet us in Indonesian was a pleasant surprise, I think it's really sweet of you!

I'm not sure what else to say, I'm still a bit sad I didn't get the chance to buy the merchandise before it sold out (in less than two hours after the booth opened). I don't have anything to remember the concert clearly in the future, but I guess that's part of the fun and why I'm writing this too.

As one of your top 0.5% listeners worldwide on Spotify in 2023, with 「Odo」 as my number 1 song, thank you for singing it as your final song. I hope you get to enjoy Jakarta as much as your fans enjoyed your concert, we can't wait to have you back here again!
