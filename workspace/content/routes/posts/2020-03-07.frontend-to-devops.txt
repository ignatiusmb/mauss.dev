> Learning DevOps was one of my most exhausting and demanding task, but it might be the most satisfying and rewarding thing once I got it

Wow, am I glad to learn DevOps. It was a grueling (almost) 4 weeks just to set up my team's CI/CD and get it working. But the results were amazing, every code is automatically linted and tested with automatic code analysis, and all codes that have passed through the third job and merged into our default branch gets built immediately, deployed to our App Center and ready to download and use in a matter of minutes.

How is all of that possible, and why did I just discovered this?!?
