description: defining hate as an active and corrosive process.

hate is an *active* process, a conscious — or unconscious — expenditure of energy. it is the act of ruminating, of wishing harm, of allowing one's thoughts to be consumed by intense hostility. it is this *active* nature that makes it uniquely draining and dangerous. unlike hate, dislike is passive; it is a preference or a judgment.

i do not use the word 'hate' lightly, reserving it for a specific emotional process, distinct from mere dislike or aversion. however, this article is not about the "hate" for abstract concepts like injustice or cruelty, which can be a motivating force for good. it is about *interpersonal hate* — the active, sustained hostility directed from one person to another.

> Hate is too great a burden to bear. It injures the hater more than it injures the hated. \
> — Coretta Scott King

i imagine King's description of hate as a literal description of the cost of carrying such a burden, not just a metaphorical one. interpersonal hate exacts this toll on the hater in several ways:

- **it consumes cognitive resources.** \
  the energy spent on hate is energy not spent on self-improvement or living a fulfilling life. it distracts from productive thoughts and actions.
- **it clouds judgment.** \
  hate narrows perspective, making one reactive and incapable of objective thought. it demands that new information be filtered through the lens of hostility.
- **it prevents positive emotions.** \
  it is difficult, if not impossible, to simultaneously harbor hate and cultivate peace, joy, or genuine connection. the former consumes the emotional capacity for the latter.

if i find myself feeling this *active* interpersonal hate, i take it as a critical signal that i should reevaluate my *own state*. it is an indication that i have made a choice — conscious or not — to allocate my finite energy toward a self-destructive process. my life is too short to bear that cost.
