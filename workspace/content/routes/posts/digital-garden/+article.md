a garden is, by nature, a place of growth and change. a digital garden builds on that idea — cultivating knowledge and treating your site as something that evolves over time. instead of the linear nature of traditional blogs, it encourages pieces to be interconnected.

just like a physical garden, it's filled with a collection of "plants" that are inherently exploratory. they aren't strictly organized by publication date; some may bloom faster than others, and some may need more time to develop. all of them contribute to the overall ecosystem of the garden.

## ideas

the "plants" in a digital garden are a collection of notes, essays, and articles, all grouped as *ideas*. they aren't required to be polished or complete; ideas can be in various stages of development. this allows for a more organic growth of knowledge, evolving as you revisit and refine your thoughts.

these ideas are interconnected through hyperlinks, forming a web of knowledge rather than isolated entries or chronological archives. this encourages the exploration and discovery of related concepts. emphasis is placed on the process and contextual understanding rather than on polished presentation.

## cultivation

we want the things we consume to also increase our creation, rather than mindlessly scrolling and getting lost in the noise. a digital garden encourages active engagement with ideas, fostering deeper understanding and long-term retention. by collecting insights and "planting" them in the garden, we give shade to our future selves.

the site's structure is more fluid and often reflects the author's mental model. it is a record of thinking processes that invites readers into someone's evolving understanding rather than a finished body of work — a reminder that growth takes time, and ideas too deserve patience and care.

## structural

our brains are powerful, but even they have their limits — especially in this age of abundance, where we often consume more than we create and everything competes for our attention. mindless consumption leads to shallow understanding and forgetfulness, yet even active engagement can overwhelm the mind when information piles up faster than it can be processed. this is where taking notes and "planting" ideas becomes essential.

one of the best things about having an idea that finally *blooms* is that it can now act as the base for other ideas to grow from. the hard part of collecting, organizing, cultivating, and making everything coherent is done. bloomed ideas don't need to be perfect or complete, but they are fully formed thoughts — structured and ready to be shared or linked back to when needed.

## audience

be selfish and write for yourself — for personal growth, for your own satisfaction. a digital garden is a space to explore and develop ideas without the pressure of external validation. it's a place to nurture your thoughts and watch them evolve over time. focus on the joy of creation and discovery, not on how others might perceive it.

anything we create should be for ourselves first; it should be driven by motive rather than incentive. even if no one else ever sees it, the act of creation has its own merit. art without an audience is still art.
