title: The Virtue of Simplicity
description: complexity is rewarded for its noise, while simplicity is taken for granted.

simplicity gives the illusion of ease. we see something clear and effortless and assume it was quick to make. in reality, what looks simple is often the result of the hardest work — while complexity, which feels weighty and impressive, is usually the cheap substitute.

## simplicity matters

simplicity is intuitive to use, efficient to maintain, and resilient over time. fewer moving parts means fewer points of failure. for the creator, it reduces cognitive load and minimizes errors. it wins in the long run — but achieving it is anything but easy.

the final solution always looks obvious after someone else has solved it. we see the clean result and wonder why experts were needed at all, overlooking the years of failure and practice that made it possible. that is hindsight bias.

simplicity rarely gets credit. it is not the absence of complexity, but the work of taming it. its value lies in solving hard problems with the simplest possible answer, stripping away the nonessential even when each part is valuable on its own.

## complexity bias

when we don't understand something, we assume it must have been difficult to create. a system with many moving parts looks impressive, as if the act of coordinating them proves mastery. if we struggle to use it, we assume its creators must be brilliant.

this bias is reinforced by novelty. work that invents new parts is commended more than work that adapts or refines what already exists. flexible systems with endless options are praised as advanced, even when a simpler approach would have sufficed.

complexity also sells better than simplicity. more layers, more features, more jargon — all of it justifies higher prices and signals "premium". in competitive industries, piling on features is the fastest way to look innovative. it fills résumés with buzzwords and creates the illusion of progress. complexity becomes a status symbol rather than a necessity.

## the vicious cycle

complexity is contagious. once a system becomes bloated, it tends to stay that way. new features stack on top of old ones, quick fixes pile into technical debt, and the result is a system no one fully understands — but everyone tolerates because "that's how it's always been".

few dare to simplify an inherited mess for fear of breaking something, so patches and add-ons keep stacking up. tight budgets and timelines encourage more shortcuts and workarounds, until no one remembers how the system works and the bus factor drops to zero.

once entrenched, complexity reshapes the culture around it. teams learn to fear change, to patch rather than address the root problem, to measure effort by volume instead of clarity. the system becomes self-preserving, not because it works well, but because no one dares to touch it.

## the vanity of complexity

designing for complexity disrespects both users and the craft. it may signal laziness, lack of understanding, or worse — the narcissism of showing off how clever something looks rather than how well it works. whatever the motive, the result is a disservice to everyone.

complexity flatters its creators more than it serves its users. the system is designed to be admired rather than used. it insults both the craft and those who must rely on it daily. ego-driven complexity may impress at first glance, but in practice it reveals insecurity by choosing spectacle over substance.

## mastery made invisible

simplicity is often mistaken for a lack of effort or for cheapness, when in truth it is built on many failures, countless iterations, and refinements over flaws so small the ordinary eye would never notice. the mark of mastery is making the difficult look effortless, as if anyone could do it.

simplicity is not subtraction for its own sake. it is the deliberate exclusion of everything unnecessary, redundant, or distracting. achieving it demands discipline to resist needless additions and the patience to polish until nothing more can be removed without loss.

simplicity, when done well, is invisible — a mastery that hides its own cost and leaves no trace. it is the essence of [The Art of Less](/posts/art-of-less).
