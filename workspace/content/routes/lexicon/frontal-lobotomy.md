A frontal lobotomy is a surgical procedure that was once performed on the brain of someone who suffered from certain psychiatric conditions. Now considered a barbaric procedure, frontal lobotomies were developed and performed at a time when the mentally ill were routinely placed in asylums. While the cure rate was not high, it was the first treatment that showed any improvement at all for many patients. In this procedure, the patient has the connection to the prefrontal cortex — the front section of the frontal lobe of the brain — severed.
