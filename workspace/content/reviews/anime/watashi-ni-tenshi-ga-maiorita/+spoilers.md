There's not much to discuss here, but one thing I'd like to point out is

> It's okay. As long as everyone's smiling...

You know she's a genuinely good person deep down, despite the fact that she's acting like a huge creep at first towards Hana. She's just a little awkward and no friends to channel all of her hobbies. But, she's trying her best and forces herself to get out of her comfort zone for something she loves is something to be commended.

Aside from that, despite being inside all the time, Miyako is really talented. She can cook, bake, make clothes, does her tasks extremely well, and most importantly, be a good sister. This is why I like her the most. Hinata, on the other hand, is just the cutest out of all the kids.
