# Alkamauss garden <img align="right" src="./workspace/apex/static/favicon.svg" alt="logo" height="40" />

a monorepo for the Alkamauss digital garden â€” my personal site and some projects on subdomains. the *garden* metaphor is a way of treating the site as something that grows and changes over time, rather than a fixed publication. this is mostly for myself, but kept public so anyone can browse around.
