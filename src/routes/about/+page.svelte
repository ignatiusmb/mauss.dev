	<p>Hey, welcome to Alchemauss digital corner! A diary-like journey, written through the kaleidoscope of my experiences, inspirations, and aspirations. A virtual abode to serve as a canvas, expressing thoughts and emotions authentically.</p>

	<!-- prettier-ignore -->
	<p>Writing isn't just a form of communication, it is a healthy way to express ourself by being a transformative and enriching practice that can profoundly benefit our mental, emotional, and even physical well-being. With the right mindset, writing can be a powerful tool to help you better understand ourself, our experiences, as well as the world around you.</p>

	<!-- prettier-ignore -->
	<p>I need a place where I can enjoy expressing myself freely and also enjoy surfing through the site and reading comfortably, and there's really no other place like home because that's specifically built and tailored to your likings. In this case, I needed to build that home first before I can get comfortable, and that's how this website came to be.</p>

	<h2>About the Author</h2>
	<p>Hello, Igna here ðŸ‘‹</p>

	<!-- prettier-ignore -->
	<p>I used to be spoiled by swipe/glide typing and other autocompletion tech, so I'm slowly working back towards touch typing and placing my fingers correctly on the keyboard, at least when I'm working with one. My WPM is currently around 90 and above, sometimes above 100 on a good day.</p>

	<!-- prettier-ignore -->
	<p>I love learning when I can make it fun, and I'm currently deep into learning languages and cultures from all around the world. In my free time, I try to prioritize exploring as many things as I can and building up or improving upon my skills. Lately, I'm focused on bouldering, tennis, and running (or more accurately, endurance), take a look at the activities section below!</p>

	<h3>Socials</h3>
