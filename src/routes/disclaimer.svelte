      Purely done as a hobby of mine as well as to express my gratitude, with the intent of supporting the authors and
      the team behind all those creative content. The reviews is solely made as a guide to help decide for yourself
      whether you choose to consume the content or not.

    All of that being said, I hope that we can move past blaming or hating what I said. If you disagree with something,
    I would welcome a discussion. It would be my privilege to learn from what you have to teach me. Direct contributions
    are also welcome at this
