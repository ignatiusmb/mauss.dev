		<h2>Hello, Igna here 👋</h2>

		<!-- prettier-ignore -->
		<p>I find joy in connecting with people and exploring the world around me. I believe there's a lot of things to learn from others, particularly in domains beyond my expertise. I strive to not pass judgement based on rumors or preconceived notions, but rather through personal interactions.</p>
		<!-- prettier-ignore -->
		<p>I'm passionate about learning new and exciting things, especially when I'm able to make it fun and engaging. I'm currently immersing myself in the fascinating world of languages and cultures from all around the world. In my spare time, I try to explore as many things as I can and honing my skills. My current focus revolves around bouldering, tennis, and endurance running.</p>
		<!-- prettier-ignore -->
		<p>In its beautiful and unpredictable way, I have learned to appreciate all the small moments in life, embracing both the joy and pain, growing with them together. Check out my latest life reflection, <a href="/posts/24k-journey">24K Journey - The Pursuit of a Meaningful Life</a>.</p>

	<h2 id="expertise">Expertise</h2>
	<!-- prettier-ignore -->
	<p>I'm a software engineer by trade, but I like to see myself as a software alchemist. Throughout my career, I've delved into a wide spectrum of projects and honed a unique skill for <em>transmuting</em> software and streamlining code. My specialization lies in the art of converting intricate or troublesome code into a more concise and maintainable format. This simplifies the debugging process, resulting in simpler bug fixes and significantly faster development cycles.</p>
	<!-- prettier-ignore -->
	<p>While I have the skills to be a full-stack engineer, my primary focus and passion lie in the frontend development, which is to craft user-friendly interfaces and delightful user experiences. As one of the core maintainers of <a href="https://github.com/sveltejs">Svelte</a>, I'm deeply connected with the frontend community, actively contributing to its growth and development. I work independently between GMT+7 to GMT+8, and most of it is open source and publicly available on GitHub.</p>

	<h2 id="socials">Socials</h2>
	<!-- prettier-ignore -->
	<p>I'm always eager to explore new opportunities and collaborations, let's connect and explore the possibilities together! Though I don't use most or all of them as often as I'd like, I still check them from time to time. Contact or find me anywhere here:</p>
